ParadeDB (Postgres &#43; pg_vector) and LanceDB are suggested for scalability and hybrid search. GraphRAG/LightRAG approaches can be used but are computationally expensive due to graph-based complexity. Horizontal scaling is supported by modern vector DBs through sharding and replication, though graph traversal slows down as data grows. Embedding models like stella_en_400M_v5 are recommended, with binary embeddings (quantized vectors) suggested to reduce storage and improve performance. HNSW indexing is a popular choice, while alternatives like IVF or IVF-PQ can improve performance through cluster-based indexing. Sparse rerankers like BM25 combined with dense embeddings enable hybrid search for better results. Index creation is more efficient when the index is dropped before ingestion and rebuilt after data ingestion is complete. Chunking strategies, like adaptive window chunking, dynamically adjust chunk sizes based on dataset requirements. Proper chunk overlap is critical to avoid losing context during retrieval. Preprocessing should include metadata extraction, semantic enrichment, and duplicate removal to optimize embeddings and indexing. Efficient pipelines are essential for handling diverse document types such as PDFs, scanned images, and statistical data. Segmenting documents by topic or content type and routing them to appropriate vector DBs improves pipeline efficiency. Middleware layers can compress, deduplicate, and summarize embeddings to optimize data ingestion. Azure AI Search is recommended for enterprise-level ingestion pipelines. Hybrid RAG combines dense vector search and sparse retrieval (e.g., BM25) for improved performance and relevance. Hierarchical RAG methods involve topic-based sorting before diving into chunk-level retrieval. ElasticSearch and BM25 are suggested as alternatives to vector DBs for certain domains with better relevance. Fine-tuning models on 20M documents can encode domain-specific knowledge but is more expensive and risks overfitting. RAG is cheaper, faster, and more flexible than fine-tuning and is preferred for large-scale data retrieval. Embedding 20M documents can take significant time but can be parallelized with multiple GPUs, costing between $1,000 and $20,000. Trade-offs between speed, cost, and accuracy can be adjusted by tweaking clustering sizes or chunking strategies. Ensure the dataset is relevant and up-to-date since larger scales do not always yield better results. Vendor solutions like Azure AI Search are helpful but should be used cautiously to avoid vendor lock-in. Iterative testing is necessary to identify the best combination of embeddings, chunking, and retrieval strategies for the specific dataset. Critics argue RAG struggles at scale, but others dismiss this as overly pessimistic, citing successful implementations at larger scales. https://old.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1ime8ja/a_modern_python_repository_template_with_uv_and/ Showcased a modern Python repository template Features UV and Just for self-hosting Aims to provide a clean and minimalistic template Includes example use cases and explanations Meant to serve as a starting point for new projects https://github.com/ranjanprj/agentollama The Agentollama Framework enables creation, execution, and monitoring of intelligent Agents without writing business logic.

<p>This is an introduction to the FlashLearn library, which provides a simple way to integrate large language models (LLMs) into workflows. The library aims to make it easy for startups to use LLMs in their products.</p>
<p>The text describes how to create custom LLM transformations using FlashLearn&rsquo;s skills API, which allows users to create and reuse pre-trained LLM models. It also discusses the library&rsquo;s features, such as parallel processing, cost estimation, and error handling.</p>
<p>Here are some key points from the introduction:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Simple and Uniform Workflow</strong>: FlashLearn provides a simple and uniform workflow for using LLMs, making it easy for startups to integrate these models into their products.</li>
<li><strong>Consistent JSON Output</strong>: The library ensures that all output is well-structured JSON, which makes it easy to analyze and debug the results.</li>
<li><strong>Parallel Processing</strong>: FlashLearn can process multiple tasks in parallel, which significantly improves performance and reduces processing time.</li>

<li>Building AI-Agents using LLMs can be simple, but it&rsquo;s often entertaining to watch them struggle.</li>
<li>A FLAT approach treats LLM interactions like programming constructs for control and predictability.</li>
<li>The F.L.A.T library provides a tiny AI library with features like binary decisions, classification, structured data extraction, tool calling, parallelization, observability, and more.</li>
<li>You can build powerful Agents using absolute simplicity.</li>
<li>Python&rsquo;s if/else statements and functions are essential for building logic that controls the workflow of your Agent.</li>
<li>LLMs need to be controlled with life choices, like classifying messages into different categories.</li>
<li>You can define object schemas to fill out objects like a trained monkey with a PhD in data entry.</li>
<li>Calling functions is essential, but you want the LLM to figure out arguments for you.</li>
<li>Functions can be called sequentially or in parallel using the get_functions method.</li>
<li>You can also use the get_string and get_stream methods for simple string responses and streaming the response from the LLM.</li>
<li>Tweaking LLM parameters on the fly is possible with a slick configuration pattern that temporarily overrides any parameter without affecting the base configuration.</li>
<li>Logging and observability are crucial to understand what your LLM does in its spare time.</li>
<li>The F.L.A.T library provides methods like set_context, add_context, clear_context, and delete_from_context to manage context.</li>

<ul>
<li>Autonomous AI agents are transforming decision-making processes in tasks like web browsing, video editing, and file management.</li>
<li>These systems struggle in complex environments due to balancing exploitation and exploration.</li>
<li>A key challenge lies in adapting to unpredictable changes and generalizing knowledge across contexts.</li>
<li>ExACT is an approach for teaching AI agents to explore more effectively.</li>
<li>ExACT combines Reflective-MCTS (R-MCTS) and Exploratory Learning techniques.</li>
<li>R-MCTS builds on MCTS, introducing features like contrastive reflection and a multi-agent debate function.</li>
<li>Exploratory Learning enables agents to dynamically search and adjust computational resources during testing.</li>
<li>ExACT demonstrates strong computational scalability during training and testing.</li>
<li>R-MCTS outperforms previous best-performing methods in VisualWebArena environments.</li>
<li>ExACT achieves performance improvement, scalable test-time compute, and improved generalization on unseen tasks.</li>
<li>Continued exploration is needed to improve AI agents&rsquo; decision-making in real-world scenarios with constraints like time or resources.</li>
<li>The ExACT framework can be accessed at the GitHub repository.</li>

<li>Working in data science can be hard to share insights from complex datasets using only static figures</li>
<li>Pre-generated figures often fail to capture all facets that describe interesting data&rsquo;s shape and meaning</li>
<li>Powerful technologies are available for presenting interactive figures, but come with tradeoffs</li>
<li>A recently released Python library called marimo opens up new opportunities for publishing interactive visualizations</li>
<li>Marimo allows for free publication of interactive data visualizations across the entire field of data science</li>

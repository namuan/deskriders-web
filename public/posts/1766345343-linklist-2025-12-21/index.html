which is more significant than a typical OCR model. - Traditional vision LLM tokens were inefficient, often requiring more space than text tokens (e.g., 10k words → 15k tokens or 30k-60k visual tokens). - DeepSeek achieved 10x better compression with vision tokens compared to text tokens (10k words → 1,500 compressed visual tokens). - This aligns with human memory, where visual recall (e.g., book page layout) is often more efficient than textual recall. - Unclear how this affects LLM reasoning—whether compressed visual tokens impact articulation or cognitive performance. - Potential to expand context sizes significantly, especially when combined with sparse attention techniques. - Google (Gemini) may already use similar methods, explaining its large context size and OCR efficiency, but keeps it secret. - DeepSeek open-sourced their model, allowing public exploration and experimentation. - Even with potential trade-offs (e.g., lossy attention), this could enable frontier LLMs with 10-20 million token context windows. - Practical applications: - Storing entire company documents in a prompt preamble for efficient querying. - Caching entire codebases and updating them via git diffs. - Analogy to physicist Hans Bethe, who memorized vast data for seamless problem-solving. - This approach could expand working memory capacity by 10x or more. https://github.com/hauxir/macos-live-screensaver - A macOS screensaver that plays live video streams. - Supports YouTube videos and direct HLS streams. - Also available: Android TV Live Screensaver. - Turn any live stream into your screensaver/lockscreen. https://github.com/requie/LLMSecurityGuide - Comprehensive guide to offensive and defensive security for Large Language Models and Agentic AI Systems https://github.com/youkchansim/tree-of-thought - Systematic problem-solving framework for Claude Code CLI based on Princeton NLP research - Tree of Thought (ToT) enables AI to solve complex problems through systematic exploration of solution spaces - Generates multiple solution paths at each decision point - Evaluates and compares different approaches systematically - Backtracks and explores alternatives when paths don&#39;t work - Finds optimal solutions through structured search https://github.com/huntoai/phishing-ai-agent - AI agent designed to identify vulnerable employees susceptible to phishing attacks - Uses public data sources to gather information and assess vulnerability https://github.com/ArmanShirzad/fastapi-production-template - Production-ready FastAPI template with Docker, CI/CD, observability, and one-click deployment to Render or Koyeb - UV package management for faster, more reliable builds - FastAPI with Python 3.12 https://magazine.sebastianraschka.com/p/from-gpt-2-to-gpt-oss-analyzing-the - OpenAI released gpt-oss-120b and gpt-oss-20b, their first open-weight models since GPT-2 in 2019. - These models can run locally with optimizations like MXFP4 quantization. - The architecture builds on the transformer design but includes several modern tweaks. - Key changes from GPT-2: - Removal of dropout (no longer needed due to single-epoch training). - Replacement of absolute positional embeddings with RoPE (Rotary Position Embedding). - Swish/SwiGLU activation functions replace GELU for computational efficiency. - Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) replaces single feed-forward modules for sparse activation. - Grouped Query Attention (GQA) replaces Multi-Head Attention (MHA) for efficiency. - Sliding window attention alternates with full-context layers to reduce compute costs. - RMSNorm replaces LayerNorm for cheaper normalization. - Comparison with Qwen3: - gpt-oss is wider (larger embedding dimensions) while Qwen3 is deeper (more transformer blocks). - gpt-oss uses fewer, larger experts (32 vs. 128 in Qwen3) but activates fewer per token (4 vs. 8). - Both use GQA, but gpt-oss adds sliding window attention. - gpt-oss includes attention bias units (rare in modern models) and attention sinks (learned per-head bias logits). - Training details: - Trained on mostly English, text-only datasets with a focus on STEM, coding, and general knowledge. - Includes supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning stages. - 2.1 million H100-hours for gpt-oss-120b (10x less for gpt-oss-20b). - Reasoning capabilities: - Supports adjustable reasoning effort (low/medium/high) via system prompts. - Designed for tool use, potentially reducing reliance on memorization. - MXFP4 optimization: - Enables single-GPU inference (80GB H100 for 120B model, 16GB VRAM for 20B model). - Requires RTX 50-series or newer for full efficiency (older GPUs supported with higher memory usage). - Benchmarks: - Competitive with proprietary models like GPT-5 and Qwen3 in reasoning tasks. - Not yet listed on LM Arena leaderboard; early users report high hallucination rates. - Licensing: - Apache 2.0 license (open-weight, not full open-source). - Allows commercial use and distillation into other models. - GPT-5 context: - Released shortly after gpt-oss, showing OpenAI’s open models are close to proprietary performance. - Additional notes: - Attention sinks stabilize long-context scenarios without modifying input tokens. - Sliding window attention (128 tokens) is smaller than in other models (e.g., Gemma’s 1024 tokens). - No base models released (only instruction-tuned versions), unlike Qwen3. https://github.com/theaniketgiri/create-llm - CLI tool for scaffolding LLM creation and training - Create production-ready LLM training projects in seconds - Similar to create-next-app but for training custom language models https://github.com/kchander/magix-extension - AI-Powered Website Customization in Your Browser - Magix is a powerful Chrome extension that lets you modify any website using natural language - No coding required - just describe what you want, and watch as AI generates and applies the changes in real-time - Think of it as ChatGPT meets Tampermonkey - the conversational intelligence of AI combined with the power of custom scripts - 🎨 Customize Any Site - Dark mode for sites that don&#39;t have it, remove annoying elements, add missing features - 💬 Chat-Based Interface - Iteratively improve your modifications through conversation - 🔒 Privacy-First - Uses your own API keys, no data collection - 🌐 Community Sharing - Discover and install modifications made by others - ⚡ Instant Results - See changes applied in real-time https://github.com/DeutscheKI/jetbrains-mini-agent - OfflineAI is a privacy-optimized LLM coding agent. - Works best with `Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B-Instruct-UD-Q4_K_XL.gguf` on RTX 3090 or higher. - Activate by clicking in source code and pressing `Ctrl&#43;Alt&#43;Shift&#43;H` (for Help). - OfflineAI Chat window opens; type a task and start with `Ctrl&#43;Return`. - Cancel tasks with the &#34;Reset Chat History&#34; button (top right). - Agent never modifies files directly; shows diffs in the IDE. https://github.com/swannysec/lessons-from-github - A compilation of professional principles and lessons learned from nearly a decade defending the internet from baddies at GitHub - Practical Guidance for Security and Engineering Professionals https://eugeneyan.com/writing/principal/ - Different principals have different strengths: deep expertise, horizontal influence, technical leadership, or cross-org alignment. - Principals should remain hands-on, but their core role shifts to vision, design, sponsorship, and enabling others. - Principals act as part-time PMs, engineers, designers, and more—nothing is outside their scope. - More communication, influence, and cross-team collaboration are required; avoid shipping org charts to customers. - Being right isn’t enough—you must convince others to act, build momentum, and secure sponsorship. - Principals often teach the org to value new ideas, even if success rates are low (e.g., 3 out of 10 pitches). - Focus on work that won’t happen without you—prototype, align orgs, or define long-term vision. - Connecting teams, reusing solutions, and identifying growth opportunities can be more valuable than doing the work yourself. - Scale impact by coaching and mentoring others; set aside time for office hours or regular syncs. - Transition ownership to others—let them drive direction, even if their approach differs from yours. - Create space in meetings for others to contribute; avoid dominating discussions. - Silence in meetings can signal trust—if the team is on track, step back. - In exec meetings, focus on meaningful questions and decisions only they can make. - Guard your time—avoid becoming the &#34;go-to&#34; person for every meeting or review. - If you can’t justify why a project needs a principal, reconsider its priority. - Leverage organizational privilege to improve outcomes with minimal effort. - Be mindful of your influence—casual comments may be overinterpreted. - Always explain the &#34;why&#34; behind your decisions to prevent blind adherence. - Stay connected with teams through reviews, demos, or informal interactions. - Help teams see the bigger picture beyond day-to-day delivery. - Balance big-picture thinking with pragmatic, local solutions. - Decline low-quality feedback requests if you lack sufficient context. - Engage with interns—early check-ins and meaningful projects can be transformative. - Remove yourself from the critical path; empower others to take ownership. - If promoted, continue what made you successful—engage with peers and define your focus. - Autonomy comes with responsibility—choose high-leverage problems, not just what you prefer. - Define your charter: owner (deep involvement), sponsor (alignment/drive), or consultant (guidance). - Build a peer network—being a principal can feel isolating. - Prioritize personal growth and well-being to avoid burnout. - Keep learning—timebox stagnant projects and seek external knowledge (papers, prototypes). https://github.com/gruquilla/FinAPy - Single-stock analysis using Python and local machine learning/ AI tools (Ollama, LSTM).

which is more significant than a typical OCR model. - Traditional vision LLM tokens were inefficient, often requiring more space than text tokens (e.g., 10k words → 15k tokens or 30k-60k visual tokens). - DeepSeek achieved 10x better compression with vision tokens compared to text tokens (10k words → 1,500 compressed visual tokens). - This aligns with human memory, where visual recall (e.g., book page layout) is often more efficient than textual recall. - Unclear how this affects LLM reasoning—whether compressed visual tokens impact articulation or cognitive performance. - Potential to expand context sizes significantly, especially when combined with sparse attention techniques. - Google (Gemini) may already use similar methods, explaining its large context size and OCR efficiency, but keeps it secret. - DeepSeek open-sourced their model, allowing public exploration and experimentation. - Even with potential trade-offs (e.g., lossy attention), this could enable frontier LLMs with 10-20 million token context windows. - Practical applications: - Storing entire company documents in a prompt preamble for efficient querying. - Caching entire codebases and updating them via git diffs. - Analogy to physicist Hans Bethe, who memorized vast data for seamless problem-solving. - This approach could expand working memory capacity by 10x or more. https://github.com/hauxir/macos-live-screensaver - A macOS screensaver that plays live video streams. - Supports YouTube videos and direct HLS streams. - Also available: Android TV Live Screensaver. - Turn any live stream into your screensaver/lockscreen. https://github.com/requie/LLMSecurityGuide - Comprehensive guide to offensive and defensive security for Large Language Models and Agentic AI Systems https://github.com/youkchansim/tree-of-thought - Systematic problem-solving framework for Claude Code CLI based on Princeton NLP research - Tree of Thought (ToT) enables AI to solve complex problems through systematic exploration of solution spaces - Generates multiple solution paths at each decision point - Evaluates and compares different approaches systematically - Backtracks and explores alternatives when paths don&#39;t work - Finds optimal solutions through structured search https://github.com/huntoai/phishing-ai-agent - AI agent designed to identify vulnerable employees susceptible to phishing attacks - Uses public data sources to gather information and assess vulnerability https://github.com/ArmanShirzad/fastapi-production-template - Production-ready FastAPI template with Docker, CI/CD, observability, and one-click deployment to Render or Koyeb - UV package management for faster, more reliable builds - FastAPI with Python 3.12 https://magazine.sebastianraschka.com/p/from-gpt-2-to-gpt-oss-analyzing-the - OpenAI released gpt-oss-120b and gpt-oss-20b, their first open-weight models since GPT-2 in 2019. - These models can run locally with optimizations like MXFP4 quantization. - The architecture builds on the transformer design but includes several modern tweaks. - Key changes from GPT-2: - Removal of dropout (no longer needed due to single-epoch training). - Replacement of absolute positional embeddings with RoPE (Rotary Position Embedding). - Swish/SwiGLU activation functions replace GELU for computational efficiency. - Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) replaces single feed-forward modules for sparse activation. - Grouped Query Attention (GQA) replaces Multi-Head Attention (MHA) for efficiency. - Sliding window attention alternates with full-context layers to reduce compute costs. - RMSNorm replaces LayerNorm for cheaper normalization. - Comparison with Qwen3: - gpt-oss is wider (larger embedding dimensions) while Qwen3 is deeper (more transformer blocks). - gpt-oss uses fewer, larger experts (32 vs. 128 in Qwen3) but activates fewer per token (4 vs. 8). - Both use GQA, but gpt-oss adds sliding window attention. - gpt-oss includes attention bias units (rare in modern models) and attention sinks (learned per-head bias logits). - Training details: - Trained on mostly English, text-only datasets with a focus on STEM, coding, and general knowledge. - Includes supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning stages. - 2.1 million H100-hours for gpt-oss-120b (10x less for gpt-oss-20b). - Reasoning capabilities: - Supports adjustable reasoning effort (low/medium/high) via system prompts. - Designed for tool use, potentially reducing reliance on memorization. - MXFP4 optimization: - Enables single-GPU inference (80GB H100 for 120B model, 16GB VRAM for 20B model). - Requires RTX 50-series or newer for full efficiency (older GPUs supported with higher memory usage). - Benchmarks: - Competitive with proprietary models like GPT-5 and Qwen3 in reasoning tasks. - Not yet listed on LM Arena leaderboard; early users report high hallucination rates. - Licensing: - Apache 2.0 license (open-weight, not full open-source). - Allows commercial use and distillation into other models. - GPT-5 context: - Released shortly after gpt-oss, showing OpenAI’s open models are close to proprietary performance. - Additional notes: - Attention sinks stabilize long-context scenarios without modifying input tokens. - Sliding window attention (128 tokens) is smaller than in other models (e.g., Gemma’s 1024 tokens). - No base models released (only instruction-tuned versions), unlike Qwen3. https://github.com/theaniketgiri/create-llm - CLI tool for scaffolding LLM creation and training - Create production-ready LLM training projects in seconds - Similar to create-next-app but for training custom language models https://github.com/kchander/magix-extension - AI-Powered Website Customization in Your Browser - Magix is a powerful Chrome extension that lets you modify any website using natural language - No coding required - just describe what you want, and watch as AI generates and applies the changes in real-time - Think of it as ChatGPT meets Tampermonkey - the conversational intelligence of AI combined with the power of custom scripts - 🎨 Customize Any Site - Dark mode for sites that don&#39;t have it, remove annoying elements, add missing features - 💬 Chat-Based Interface - Iteratively improve your modifications through conversation - 🔒 Privacy-First - Uses your own API keys, no data collection - 🌐 Community Sharing - Discover and install modifications made by others - ⚡ Instant Results - See changes applied in real-time https://github.com/DeutscheKI/jetbrains-mini-agent - OfflineAI is a privacy-optimized LLM coding agent. - Works best with `Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B-Instruct-UD-Q4_K_XL.gguf` on RTX 3090 or higher. - Activate by clicking in source code and pressing `Ctrl&#43;Alt&#43;Shift&#43;H` (for Help). - OfflineAI Chat window opens;

avoid shipping org charts to customers. - Being right isn’t enough—you must convince others to act, build momentum, and secure sponsorship. - Principals often teach the org to value new ideas, even if success rates are low (e.g., 3 out of 10 pitches). - Focus on work that won’t happen without you—prototype, align orgs, or define long-term vision. - Connecting teams, reusing solutions, and identifying growth opportunities can be more valuable than doing the work yourself. - Scale impact by coaching and mentoring others; set aside time for office hours or regular syncs. - Transition ownership to others—let them drive direction, even if their approach differs from yours. - Create space in meetings for others to contribute; avoid dominating discussions. - Silence in meetings can signal trust—if the team is on track, step back. - In exec meetings, focus on meaningful questions and decisions only they can make. - Guard your time—avoid becoming the &#34;go-to&#34; person for every meeting or review. - If you can’t justify why a project needs a principal, reconsider its priority. - Leverage organizational privilege to improve outcomes with minimal effort. - Be mindful of your influence—casual comments may be overinterpreted. - Always explain the &#34;why&#34; behind your decisions to prevent blind adherence. - Stay connected with teams through reviews, demos, or informal interactions. - Help teams see the bigger picture beyond day-to-day delivery. - Balance big-picture thinking with pragmatic, local solutions. - Decline low-quality feedback requests if you lack sufficient context. - Engage with interns—early check-ins and meaningful projects can be transformative. - Remove yourself from the critical path; empower others to take ownership. - If promoted, continue what made you successful—engage with peers and define your focus. - Autonomy comes with responsibility—choose high-leverage problems, not just what you prefer. - Define your charter: owner (deep involvement), sponsor (alignment/drive), or consultant (guidance). - Build a peer network—being a principal can feel isolating. - Prioritize personal growth and well-being to avoid burnout. - Keep learning—timebox stagnant projects and seek external knowledge (papers, prototypes). https://github.com/gruquilla/FinAPy - Single-stock analysis using Python and local machine learning/ AI tools (Ollama, LSTM).

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">-</span> &#34;Time under tension&#34; in fitness (e.g., slower squats) builds more muscle; thinking benefits from a similar principle.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">-</span> Deep thinking requires sitting with disconnected ideas to combine them into something new.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">-</span> AI executives claim humans have 18 months before AI surpasses us in the workforce.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">-</span> The bigger concern isn’t AI taking jobs but humans degrading their own thinking abilities.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">-</span> AI is already affecting deep thinking, writing, and reading skills.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">-</span> Students increasingly use AI to cheat, leading to a decline in writing and critical thinking.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">-</span> Writing is thinking; outsourcing it to AI empties the mind of original thought.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">-</span> Reading scores are at a 32-year low, with many students unable to focus on long texts.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">-</span> Even elite college students struggle with reading full books or sustained focus.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">-</span> High schools have &#34;chunkified&#34; books to prepare for standardized tests, reducing deep reading.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">-</span> Writing and reading are essential for deep symbolic thinking, a key skill in the modern economy.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">-</span> AI is the latest threat to deep thinking, following TV, the internet, and smartphones.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">-</span> Literacy restructures human thought, enabling complex ideas; its decline unwires cognitive abilities.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">-</span> The skill to prioritize in the AI age: patience for long texts, holding conflicting ideas, and engaging deeply with writing.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">-</span> The author prepares their child for resilience and adaptability, emphasizing continuous learning.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">-</span> The author (who has ADD) uses AI as a tool to refine their own writing, not replace it.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">-</span> AI can be helpful if used to clarify thoughts, not to bypass thinking entirely.

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">-</span> Traditional vision LLM tokens were inefficient, often requiring more space than text tokens (e.g., 10k words → 15k tokens or 30k-60k visual tokens).
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">-</span> DeepSeek achieved 10x better compression with vision tokens compared to text tokens (10k words → 1,500 compressed visual tokens).
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">-</span> This aligns with human memory, where visual recall (e.g., book page layout) is often more efficient than textual recall.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">-</span> Unclear how this affects LLM reasoning—whether compressed visual tokens impact articulation or cognitive performance.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">-</span> Potential to expand context sizes significantly, especially when combined with sparse attention techniques.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">-</span> Google (Gemini) may already use similar methods, explaining its large context size and OCR efficiency, but keeps it secret.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">-</span> DeepSeek open-sourced their model, allowing public exploration and experimentation.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">-</span> Even with potential trade-offs (e.g., lossy attention), this could enable frontier LLMs with 10-20 million token context windows.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">-</span> Practical applications:
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#66d9ef">-</span> Storing entire company documents in a prompt preamble for efficient querying.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#66d9ef">-</span> Caching entire codebases and updating them via git diffs.

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">-</span> This approach could expand working memory capacity by 10x or more.

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">-</span> Principals should remain hands-on, but their core role shifts to vision, design, sponsorship, and enabling others.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">-</span> Principals act as part-time PMs, engineers, designers, and more—nothing is outside their scope.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">-</span> More communication, influence, and cross-team collaboration are required; avoid shipping org charts to customers.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">-</span> Being right isn’t enough—you must convince others to act, build momentum, and secure sponsorship.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">-</span> Principals often teach the org to value new ideas, even if success rates are low (e.g., 3 out of 10 pitches).
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">-</span> Focus on work that won’t happen without you—prototype, align orgs, or define long-term vision.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">-</span> Connecting teams, reusing solutions, and identifying growth opportunities can be more valuable than doing the work yourself.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">-</span> Scale impact by coaching and mentoring others; set aside time for office hours or regular syncs.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">-</span> Transition ownership to others—let them drive direction, even if their approach differs from yours.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">-</span> Create space in meetings for others to contribute; avoid dominating discussions.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">-</span> Silence in meetings can signal trust—if the team is on track, step back.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">-</span> In exec meetings, focus on meaningful questions and decisions only they can make.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">-</span> Guard your time—avoid becoming the &#34;go-to&#34; person for every meeting or review.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">-</span> If you can’t justify why a project needs a principal, reconsider its priority.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">-</span> Leverage organizational privilege to improve outcomes with minimal effort.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">-</span> Be mindful of your influence—casual comments may be overinterpreted.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">-</span> Always explain the &#34;why&#34; behind your decisions to prevent blind adherence.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">-</span> Stay connected with teams through reviews, demos, or informal interactions.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">-</span> Help teams see the bigger picture beyond day-to-day delivery.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">-</span> Balance big-picture thinking with pragmatic, local solutions.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">-</span> Decline low-quality feedback requests if you lack sufficient context.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">-</span> Engage with interns—early check-ins and meaningful projects can be transformative.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">-</span> Remove yourself from the critical path; empower others to take ownership.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">-</span> If promoted, continue what made you successful—engage with peers and define your focus.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">-</span> Autonomy comes with responsibility—choose high-leverage problems, not just what you prefer.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">-</span> Define your charter: owner (deep involvement), sponsor (alignment/drive), or consultant (guidance).
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">-</span> Build a peer network—being a principal can feel isolating.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">-</span> Prioritize personal growth and well-being to avoid burnout.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">-</span> Keep learning—timebox stagnant projects and seek external knowledge (papers, prototypes).

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">-</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">`Result`</span> in Rust can hold a success or error; <span style="color:#e6db74">`unwrap`</span> extracts the success or crashes the program (similar to <span style="color:#e6db74">`assert`</span>).
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">-</span> Debate on <span style="color:#e6db74">`assert`</span> in production misses the point—error handling is a global system property, not local.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">-</span> Error handling game: Decide if crashing (✅) or not (❌) is appropriate, with justifications provided.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">-</span> Three principles guide error handling decisions:
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#66d9ef">-</span> **Correlated failures**: If failures are uncorrelated, crashing simplifies the system; if correlated, design to reject errors and continue.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#66d9ef">-</span> **Higher-layer handling**: Traditional architectures handle low error rates; fine-grained (e.g., serverless) handle higher rates, making crashing more acceptable.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#66d9ef">-</span> **Meaningful continuation**: Some systems (e.g., databases) must crash to avoid state corruption; others can use last-known-good versions.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">-</span> Error handling must be designed globally from the start; local decisions are insufficient.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">-</span> Blast radius reduction (e.g., cell-based architectures, shuffle sharding) limits damage from errors.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">-</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">`panic`</span> (like <span style="color:#e6db74">`unwrap`</span>) is treated as a crash here; Rust’s explicitness is better than C’s silent failures.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">-</span> Suggestions: Rename <span style="color:#e6db74">`unwrap`</span> to <span style="color:#e6db74">`or_panic`</span> or enforce justifications via lints (e.g., <span style="color:#e6db74">`clippy`</span>).

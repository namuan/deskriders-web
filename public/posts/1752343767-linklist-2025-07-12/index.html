For each new item, it generates a random number between 0 and n. If that&#39;s less than k, replace the card at that index with the new one; otherwise discard the new one. - The reservoir sampling algorithm can be used in various scenarios like log collection where you want to receive at most k logs per second but never more. - A weighted variant of reservoir sampling exists for cases where some items are more valuable than others. https://github.com/arjunprabhulal?tab=repositories - AI Wanderize: intelligent travel companion that transforms trip planning from overwhelming to effortless https://simonwillison.net/2025/May/15/building-on-llms/#atom-everything * 15th May 2025: Presented a three hour workshop at PyCon US titled &#34;Building software on top of Large Language Models&#34; with interactive exercises and a comprehensive handout. * The workshop covered topics such as setup, prompting with LLM, building a text to SQL tool, structured data extraction, semantic search, and tool usage. * A detailed handout is available for participants to follow along, including: * Setup—getting LLM and related tools installed and configured * Prompting with LLM—basic prompting in the terminal and accessing logs * Prompting from Python—using LLM&#39;s Python API * Building a text to SQL tool—the first building exercise * Structured data extraction—possibly the most economically valuable application of LLMs today * Semantic search and RAG—working with embeddings and building a semantic search engine * Tool usage—the most important technique for building interesting applications on top of LLMs https://github.com/rukaya-dev/easely-pyqt?tab=readme-ov-file Easely empowers clinics to boost operational efficiency and patient care.

Here are the main sections: **Components** * Use functions as the default component type (`React.FC`). * Prefer container components with postfix &#34;Container&#34; or &#34;Page&#34;. * Feature components should be representedational, nested inside container components. * Design system components (e.g., Button) should be reusable and global. **Props** * Avoid using props to state. If necessary, prefix the prop with `initial`. * Use props argument with type instead of `React.FC` type. * Pass only necessary props to child components. * Utilize storing state in the URL for filtering, sorting, etc. **Testing** * Implement tests that are short, explicit, and pleasant to work with. * Strive for AAA pattern (Arrange-Act-Assert) in unit tests. * Keep functions pure and impure small and focused. * Write tests as isolated as possible and resilient to changes. * Black box testing is encouraged, testing implementation details is not. **Best Practices** * Avoid using React.FC type directly; instead, use the function type with props argument. * Consider refactoring render method, local states in parent components, and using composition when prop drilling becomes an issue. * Use server-state library for data fetching (e.g., react-query) and client-state library for global state is discouraged. **Code Style** * Follow the naming convention &#34;it(&#39;should ... when ...&#39;)&#34; for test descriptions. * Avoid snapshot tests unless there&#39;s a strong rationale behind them. * Keep the codebase stable by avoiding unnecessary changes to tests. Overall, this style guide emphasizes best practices, conventions, and testing principles for React development. https://github.com/doddpronter/cc_optimizer * It analyzes covered call options across all tickers listed in stocks.txt. * It calculates key features to help identify the most attractive contracts based on reward vs. risk. * Features include: * Stock Return Cap * Premium Return * Annualized Premium Return * Cost for 100 Shares * Breakeven Point * Downside Protection * Dollar Return on Premium * The tool can sort and filter results in real time to identify the highest yielding covered call setups based on return, downside protection, or breakeven price. https://github.com/arosov/lazyaider - Seamless Tmux Integration: LazyAider automatically manages tmux sessions, providing a dedicated and organized workspace with a main shell pane and a sidebar for the LazyAider application. https://github.com/KrisRehfuss/GPTNav?tab=readme-ov-file - A browser extension that adds a floating overlay to ChatGPT conversations, allowing users to quickly navigate through their questions and responses. https://github.com/carlrobertoh/ProxyAI *Connect to any model in any environment and customize your coding experience.* *Access top-tier language models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure, Mistral, and others.* *Opt for a self-hosted model for a full offline experience.* *Features:* *- Auto Apply*: Stream AI-suggested code changes into your editor. *- Use images*: Chat with images in your chat session. *- Reference files and folders*: Access project files and folders for context-aware coding assistance. *- Reference web docs*: Quickly reference web docs in your chat session. *- Reference git history*: Quickly reference commit logs and changes in your chat session. *- Search the web*: Connect to a favourite LLM and search for relevant information. *- Customize your assistant*: Choose between multiple personas for specific needs. *- Next edits*: Get multi-line edits based on recent activity as you type. *- Autocomplete code*: Receive single-line or whole-function autocomplete suggestions as you type. *- Edit code in natural language*: Highlight code, describe changes, and watch ProxyAI work its magic. *- Get name suggestions*: Get context-aware naming suggestions for methods, variables, and more. *- Generate commit messages*: Generate concise and descriptive commit messages based on changes made. https://addyo.substack.com/p/the-prompt-engineering-playbook-for This article provides an in-depth guide on prompt engineering, a crucial skill for developers working with AI code assistants. The author covers various aspects of effective prompting, including: 1. Crafting clear and context-rich prompts: Providing the necessary information about the code, problem, or feature being asked to solve. 2. Iterating with the AI: Refining solutions through multiple prompts, refining assumptions, and breaking down complex requests into smaller, manageable pieces. 3. Role-playing and personas: Treating the AI as a code reviewer, mentor, or expert in a specific stack to elicit more rigorous and explanation-rich outputs. 4. Refactoring and optimization: Defining what &#34;good&#34; looks like (e.g., faster, cleaner, more idiomatic) and leveraging the AI&#39;s knowledge of best practices to improve code quality. 5. Pitfalls to avoid: Keeping prompts neither too vague nor too overloaded, specifying intent and constraints, and being prepared to adjust when the AI&#39;s output is off-target. The author also highlights the importance of patience, iteration, and iterative dialogue in prompting, emphasizing that it&#39;s essential to approach prompting with the same clarity, patience, and thoroughness as communicating with another engineer.

Here are the main sections: **Components** * Use functions as the default component type (`React.FC`). * Prefer container components with postfix &#34;Container&#34; or &#34;Page&#34;. * Feature components should be representedational, nested inside container components. * Design system components (e.g., Button) should be reusable and global. **Props** * Avoid using props to state. If necessary, prefix the prop with `initial`. * Use props argument with type instead of `React.FC` type. * Pass only necessary props to child components. * Utilize storing state in the URL for filtering, sorting, etc. **Testing** * Implement tests that are short, explicit, and pleasant to work with. * Strive for AAA pattern (Arrange-Act-Assert) in unit tests. * Keep functions pure and impure small and focused. * Write tests as isolated as possible and resilient to changes. * Black box testing is encouraged, testing implementation details is not. **Best Practices** * Avoid using React.FC type directly; instead, use the function type with props argument. * Consider refactoring render method, local states in parent components, and using composition when prop drilling becomes an issue. * Use server-state library for data fetching (e.g., react-query) and client-state library for global state is discouraged. **Code Style** * Follow the naming convention &#34;it(&#39;should ... when ...&#39;)&#34; for test descriptions. * Avoid snapshot tests unless there&#39;s a strong rationale behind them. * Keep the codebase stable by avoiding unnecessary changes to tests. Overall, this style guide emphasizes best practices, conventions, and testing principles for React development. https://github.com/doddpronter/cc_optimizer * It analyzes covered call options across all tickers listed in stocks.txt. * It calculates key features to help identify the most attractive contracts based on reward vs. risk. * Features include: * Stock Return Cap * Premium Return * Annualized Premium Return * Cost for 100 Shares * Breakeven Point * Downside Protection * Dollar Return on Premium * The tool can sort and filter results in real time to identify the highest yielding covered call setups based on return, downside protection, or breakeven price. https://github.com/arosov/lazyaider - Seamless Tmux Integration: LazyAider automatically manages tmux sessions, providing a dedicated and organized workspace with a main shell pane and a sidebar for the LazyAider application. https://github.com/KrisRehfuss/GPTNav?tab=readme-ov-file - A browser extension that adds a floating overlay to ChatGPT conversations, allowing users to quickly navigate through their questions and responses. https://github.com/carlrobertoh/ProxyAI *Connect to any model in any environment and customize your coding experience.* *Access top-tier language models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure, Mistral, and others.* *Opt for a self-hosted model for a full offline experience.* *Features:* *- Auto Apply*: Stream AI-suggested code changes into your editor. *- Use images*: Chat with images in your chat session. *- Reference files and folders*: Access project files and folders for context-aware coding assistance. *- Reference web docs*: Quickly reference web docs in your chat session. *- Reference git history*: Quickly reference commit logs and changes in your chat session. *- Search the web*: Connect to a favourite LLM and search for relevant information. *- Customize your assistant*: Choose between multiple personas for specific needs. *- Next edits*: Get multi-line edits based on recent activity as you type. *- Autocomplete code*: Receive single-line or whole-function autocomplete suggestions as you type. *- Edit code in natural language*: Highlight code, describe changes, and watch ProxyAI work its magic. *- Get name suggestions*: Get context-aware naming suggestions for methods, variables, and more. *- Generate commit messages*: Generate concise and descriptive commit messages based on changes made. https://addyo.substack.com/p/the-prompt-engineering-playbook-for This article provides an in-depth guide on prompt engineering, a crucial skill for developers working with AI code assistants. The author covers various aspects of effective prompting, including: 1. Crafting clear and context-rich prompts: Providing the necessary information about the code, problem, or feature being asked to solve. 2. Iterating with the AI: Refining solutions through multiple prompts, refining assumptions, and breaking down complex requests into smaller, manageable pieces. 3. Role-playing and personas: Treating the AI as a code reviewer, mentor, or expert in a specific stack to elicit more rigorous and explanation-rich outputs. 4. Refactoring and optimization: Defining what &#34;good&#34; looks like (e.g., faster, cleaner, more idiomatic) and leveraging the AI&#39;s knowledge of best practices to improve code quality. 5. Pitfalls to avoid: Keeping prompts neither too vague nor too overloaded, specifying intent and constraints, and being prepared to adjust when the AI&#39;s output is off-target. The author also highlights the importance of patience, iteration, and iterative dialogue in prompting, emphasizing that it&#39;s essential to approach prompting with the same clarity, patience, and thoroughness as communicating with another engineer.

<pre tabindex="0"><code>- Reservoir sampling is a technique for selecting a fair random sample when you don&#39;t know the size of the set you&#39;re sampling from.
- It&#39;s used when you can only hold one item at a time and want every item to have an equal chance of being selected.
- The problem is that when you show n items, 1/n is the chance of each new item being chosen and then it also becomes 1/(n-1) for each previous item that gets replaced, but we only care about the probability of a new card being chosen.
- When k cards are chosen from n, there&#39;s a formula where 1/n is the chance of each new card being selected and k/(n-1) is the chance of any held card getting replaced, both probabilities staying equal.
- Reservoir sampling works by generating an array of size k for holding cards. For each new item, it generates a random number between 0 and n. If that&#39;s less than k, replace the card at that index with the new one; otherwise discard the new one.
- The reservoir sampling algorithm can be used in various scenarios like log collection where you want to receive at most k logs per second but never more.
- A weighted variant of reservoir sampling exists for cases where some items are more valuable than others.

<pre tabindex="0"><code>* The United States&#39; trade deficit is primarily driven by a persistent shortfall in domestic saving that requires foreign funding to finance domestic investment spending.
* In a closed economy, spending equals income, and therefore investment spending equals domestic saving.
* When an economy opens up to external borrowing or lending, domestic saving and investment spending can diverge.
* The saving gap framework shows that the difference between domestic saving and investment spending is equivalent to the trade deficit in terms of its overall magnitude.
* The trade deficit reflects a macroeconomic phenomenon, rather than just differences in exports and imports.
* Imports and exports are equal when revenue from exports matches spending on imports; otherwise, foreign funds buy domestic assets instead of U.S. exports.
* The trade deficit is not tied to specific items, but rather a result of the saving gap between domestic and investment spending.
* Reducing the trade deficit requires both more exports relative to imports and a narrowing of the gap between saving and investment spending.
* Focusing solely on imports and exports can be misleading, as policy changes may affect the size and composition of cross-border trade without necessarily reducing the overall deficit.
* The goal of achieving a smaller trade deficit may require painful recalibration of domestic savings and investment.
* Research has shown that episodes of substantial reductions in trade deficits are often facilitated by lower investment spending followed by higher saving.

<pre tabindex="0"><code>This is a style guide for React development, covering various aspects of coding conventions, testing, and best practices. Here are the main sections:

**Components**

* Use functions as the default component type (`React.FC`).
* Prefer container components with postfix &#34;Container&#34; or &#34;Page&#34;.
* Feature components should be representedational, nested inside container components.
* Design system components (e.g., Button) should be reusable and global.

**Props**

* Avoid using props to state. If necessary, prefix the prop with `initial`.
* Use props argument with type instead of `React.FC` type.
* Pass only necessary props to child components.
* Utilize storing state in the URL for filtering, sorting, etc.

**Testing**

* Implement tests that are short, explicit, and pleasant to work with.
* Strive for AAA pattern (Arrange-Act-Assert) in unit tests.
* Keep functions pure and impure small and focused.
* Write tests as isolated as possible and resilient to changes.
* Black box testing is encouraged, testing implementation details is not.

**Best Practices**

* Avoid using React.FC type directly; instead, use the function type with props argument.
* Consider refactoring render method, local states in parent components, and using composition when prop drilling becomes an issue.
* Use server-state library for data fetching (e.g., react-query) and client-state library for global state is discouraged.

**Code Style**

* Follow the naming convention &#34;it(&#39;should ... when ...&#39;)&#34; for test descriptions.
* Avoid snapshot tests unless there&#39;s a strong rationale behind them.
* Keep the codebase stable by avoiding unnecessary changes to tests.

Overall, this style guide emphasizes best practices, conventions, and testing principles for React development.

<pre tabindex="0"><code>This article provides an in-depth guide on prompt engineering, a crucial skill for developers working with AI code assistants. The author covers various aspects of effective prompting, including:

1. Crafting clear and context-rich prompts: Providing the necessary information about the code, problem, or feature being asked to solve.
2. Iterating with the AI: Refining solutions through multiple prompts, refining assumptions, and breaking down complex requests into smaller, manageable pieces.
3. Role-playing and personas: Treating the AI as a code reviewer, mentor, or expert in a specific stack to elicit more rigorous and explanation-rich outputs.
4. Refactoring and optimization: Defining what &#34;good&#34; looks like (e.g., faster, cleaner, more idiomatic) and leveraging the AI&#39;s knowledge of best practices to improve code quality.
5. Pitfalls to avoid: Keeping prompts neither too vague nor too overloaded, specifying intent and constraints, and being prepared to adjust when the AI&#39;s output is off-target.

The author also highlights the importance of patience, iteration, and iterative dialogue in prompting, emphasizing that it&#39;s essential to approach prompting with the same clarity, patience, and thoroughness as communicating with another engineer.

Key takeaways from this article include:

* Prompt engineering empowers developers to get more out of AI assistants.
* It&#39;s a skill that requires practice, patience, and iteration.
* Effective prompting involves providing context-rich information, refining assumptions, and breaking down complex requests into smaller pieces.

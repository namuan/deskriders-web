<p>This is an article about using the LÖVE programming framework to build prototypes for game development projects. The author shares their experience and lessons learned from building two prototypes: one for a card game and another for a notebook/pen-based game.</p>
<p><strong>Key Takeaways</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>LÖVE shines in simple tasks</strong>: The author highlights that LÖVE is well-suited for simple tasks, such as rendering health and mana bars.</li>
<li><strong>LLMs help with scaffolding work</strong>: Large Language Models (LLMs) can assist with the initial setup of prototypes by providing boilerplate code for things like drawing boxes and text.</li>
<li><strong>Card game prototype</strong>: The card game prototype was built using LÖVE, and the author found it easy to implement animations and smooth transitions between card states.</li>
<li><strong>Game engine choice</strong>: The author notes that they would use Godot Engine if their project required more complex features, such as busy worlds or advanced physics.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Lessons Learned</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Start with simple prototypes</strong>: The author emphasizes the importance of starting with simple prototypes to quickly test and validate game ideas.</li>
<li><strong>Iterate and playtest</strong>: The author stresses the importance of iterating on the prototype based on feedback from friends and testing different scenarios.</li>
<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t worry about code quality</strong>: The author notes that their prototype code may not be useful in its current state, but it&rsquo;s still open source and can serve as a starting point for others.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Next Steps</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Design a new game concept</strong>: The author plans to design a new game idea using paper and pencil before building a more polished prototype.</li>
<li><strong>Build out the MVP</strong>: Once they have a solid game idea, the author will build out a basic MVP without any art.</li>
<li><strong>Playtest with friends</strong>: The author intends to playtest their game with friends to gather feedback and iterate on the design.</li>
</ol>
<p>Overall, this article provides a helpful overview of using LÖVE for game development prototyping and offers practical advice for building simple games quickly and efficiently.</p>

<p>This is a comprehensive guide to building and using agent-based systems with the SmolAgents library. Here&rsquo;s a breakdown of the key concepts and takeaways:</p>
<p><strong>What are Agent-Based Systems?</strong></p>
<p>Agent-based systems (ABS) are computational models that consist of multiple autonomous entities, called agents, that interact with each other and their environment. ABS are often used to simulate complex systems, such as economies, societies, or ecosystems.</p>
<p><strong>SmolAgents Library</strong></p>
<p>The SmolAgents library is a Python package that provides a simple and intuitive way to build and deploy agent-based systems. It allows users to define agents, tools, and workflows using a variety of programming languages and frameworks.</p>
<p><strong>Key Concepts</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Agents</strong>: The autonomous entities in the system that interact with each other and their environment.</li>
<li><strong>Tools</strong>: Functions or classes that perform specific tasks or calculations.</li>
<li><strong>Workflows</strong>: A sequence of agent actions that achieve a specific goal.</li>
<li><strong>Model</strong>: The underlying intelligence that drives the agents&rsquo; decisions.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Building an Agent</strong></p>
<p>To build an agent, you need to define two essential components:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Tools</strong>: A list of tools that the agent will use to perform tasks or calculations.</li>
<li><strong>Model</strong>: An LLM (Large Language Model) that will provide the intelligence for the agent&rsquo;s decisions.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can choose from a variety of models, including open-source and closed models, and integrate them with your tools using the SmolAgents library.</p>

<p>This text provides a comprehensive guide on how to create and pursue a &ldquo;Life Worth Living&rdquo; (LWL) - a state of purposeful living where one engages in activities that bring fulfillment and joy. Here&rsquo;s a breakdown of the key steps:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Identify Your Values</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Reflect on what is important to you in life</li>
<li>Ask yourself, &ldquo;What matters most to me?&rdquo;</li>
<li>Consider your personal values, passions, and long-term goals</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 2: Explore and Set Goals</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Identify areas where you&rsquo;d like to improve or make changes</li>
<li>Brainstorm specific, achievable goals that align with your values</li>
<li>Make sure your goals are realistic and connected to your values (see &ldquo;Why This Goal Matters&rdquo;)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 3: Break Down Goals into Action Steps</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Divide large goals into smaller, manageable tasks (action steps)</li>
<li>Focus on what you can control and break down complex tasks into smaller ones</li>
<li>Make action steps specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 4: Take Action and Track Progress</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Set deadlines for completing action steps</li>
<li>Schedule time in your calendar to work on your LWL goals</li>
<li>Find an accountability partner or &ldquo;body double&rdquo; to support you</li>
<li>Reward yourself for progress and value-based actions</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Principles:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Focus on values, not outcomes</strong>: Align your goals with what matters most to you.</li>
<li><strong>Take action, not just think about it</strong>: Break down large goals into manageable tasks and start taking steps towards them.</li>
<li><strong>Celebrate small wins</strong>: Acknowledge and appreciate your progress, no matter how small.</li>
<li><strong>Be patient and flexible</strong>: Life is dynamic, and your goals may shift over time. Be willing to adjust and adapt.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Key Mindset Shifts:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>From &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do this&rdquo; to &ldquo;I want to do this&rdquo;</li>
<li>From &ldquo;This is a chore&rdquo; to &ldquo;This is something I enjoy&rdquo;</li>
<li>From &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not good enough&rdquo; to &ldquo;I&rsquo;m capable of achieving my goals&rdquo;</li>
</ol>
<p>By following these steps and embracing the principles and mindset shifts, you can create a Life Worth Living that brings fulfillment, joy, and purpose to your life.</p>

<li><strong>Over-engineering</strong>: Committing to making something cross-platform can lead to building an operating system or cloud provider.</li>
<li><strong>Synchronization is hard</strong>: Synchronizing data across multiple devices, platforms, or data stores is notoriously difficult and often leads to multi-billion dollar companies that specialize in this problem.</li>
<li><strong>Abstraction can be a double-edged sword</strong>: While abstraction can provide many benefits, it also introduces complexity and can lead to problems like &ldquo;mucking with data structures and state&rdquo; when trying to escape back to native code.</li>
<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t over-rely on software patterns</strong>: Many software patterns are failure-prone and should not be blindly applied.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Counter-example:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Apple&rsquo;s Mac OS evolution: The author notes that some abstractions in Mac OS seemed odd at first but became useful two releases later because there was a plan behind them. This suggests that sometimes, seemingly arbitrary design decisions can pay off in the long run.</li>

<li>Let’s Go Step-By-Step Fine-Tuning On Your MacBook</li>
<li>As models become smaller, we are seeing more and more consumer computers capable of running LLMs locally. This both dramatically reduces the barriers for people training their own models and allows for more training techniques to be tried.</li>
<li>One consumer computer that can run LLMs locally quite well is an Apple Mac. Apple took advantage of its custom silicon and created an array processing library called MLX.</li>
<li>By using MLX, Apple can run LLMs better than many other consumer computers.</li>
<li>In this blog post, I’ll explain at a high-level how MLX works, then show you how to fine-tune your own LLM locally using MLX. Finally, we’ll speed up our fine-tuned model using quantization.</li>
<li>What is MLX (and who can use it?)</li>
<li>MLX is an open-source library from Apple that lets Mac users more efficiently run programs with large tensors in them.</li>

<p>This text describes the author&rsquo;s work on a tool called &ldquo;Aider&rdquo; that aims to detect and reduce laziness in AI-generated code. The main idea behind Aider is to use a new unified diff format that focuses on semantically coherent chunks of code, rather than traditional structured diffs.</p>
<p>The author presents several key findings from their work:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Unified diffs improve GPT-4 Turbo&rsquo;s coding skills</strong>: By using the new unified diff format, Aider significantly improves GPT-4 Turbo&rsquo;s ability to handle complex coding tasks.</li>
<li><strong>Flexible patching is crucial</strong>: The tool uses flexible patching strategies to apply edits and handle variations in code formatting. These strategies are critical for success and increase the effectiveness of the unified diff format.</li>
<li><strong>Refactoring benchmark shows promise</strong>: Aider&rsquo;s new benchmark suite, which involves refactoring large amounts of code from open-source repositories, demonstrates the tool&rsquo;s potential to detect and reduce coding laziness.</li>
</ol>
<p>The author also presents several key techniques used by Aider:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Removing line numbers from hunk headers</strong>: By dropping line numbers from the diff format, the tool focuses on semantically coherent chunks of code.</li>
<li><strong>Focusing on diffs of coherent code chunks</strong>: The tool uses a simple, high-level style of unified diffs that emphasizes coherent code chunks rather than traditional structured diffs.</li>
<li><strong>Flexible patching strategies</strong>: Aider uses various patching strategies to apply edits and handle variations in code formatting.</li>
</ol>
<p>The author concludes by highlighting the potential benefits of fine-tuning models on Aider&rsquo;s unified diff format:</p>

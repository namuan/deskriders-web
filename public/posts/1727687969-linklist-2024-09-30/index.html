<pre tabindex="0"><code>* Building a Generative AI platform involves several key components and steps.

* **Step 1: Enhance Context:**  Augment queries with relevant information using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).  RAG uses retrievers (term-based or embedding-based) to fetch information from external sources (documents, databases, web searches).  Consider chunking large documents for efficient processing. Hybrid search (combining term and embedding-based retrieval) is common.  Agentic RAG allows models to interact with external tools and actions (read-only or write). Query rewriting improves retrieval accuracy.

* **Step 2: Put in Guardrails:** Implement input and output guardrails to mitigate risks. Input guardrails prevent leaking private information to external APIs and model jailbreaking. Output guardrails evaluate response quality (checking for emptiness, malformed formats, toxicity, factual inconsistencies, sensitive information, and brand risks) and manage failures (retries, human fallback).  Consider the tradeoffs between reliability and latency.

* **Step 3: Add Model Router and Gateway:**  Use routers to direct queries to appropriate models based on intent or context. Gateways provide a unified interface for interacting with various models (self-hosted or third-party).

* **Step 4: Reduce Latency with Cache:** Implement caching mechanisms (prompt cache, exact cache, semantic cache) to optimize performance and reduce costs.

* **Step 5: Add Complex Logic and Write Actions:** Incorporate complex logic and write actions to enhance system capabilities.  However, write actions increase risk.

* **Observability and Orchestration:**  Essential for monitoring, debugging, and managing the entire pipeline.  Includes metrics, logs, and traces.

* The architecture starts simple (query -&gt; model -&gt; response) and adds components iteratively.  Evaluation is crucial at each step.

<pre tabindex="0"><code>* This tutorial demonstrates simple market making using quantpylib&#39;s gateway connectors, data feeds, and order management system (OMS).
* It uses exchanges supporting `quantpylib.gateway.master.Gateway` endpoints (e.g., Binance, Hyperliquid, Bybit).
* Market making requires tracking portfolio states (orders, positions, account balance) and tick data feeds (orderbook, trades, correlated assets).
* Actions are triggered by internal clocks, trade arrivals, orderbook updates, and proprietary logic.  Actions can be immediate (`onTick`) or based on stored data.
* The example uses Bybit (`exc=&#39;bybit&#39;`), but can be adapted to other supported exchanges.
* `gateway` connects to the exchange, `oms` handles order/position management, and `feed` handles tick data subscription and retrieval.
* `BTC` trade feeds are used to compute `trade imbalance` as shared global data.
* `market_trade_handler` function processes trade messages (`msg = (ts, price, sz, dir)`) and updates `market_imbalance`.
* `main` function initializes `gateway`, `oms`, and subscribes to `BTC` trade feeds using `feed.add_trades_feed`.  It uses a buffer of 300 trades and registers `market_trade_handler`.
* `make` function (market making logic) uses `add_trades_feed` and `add_l2_book_feed` to subscribe to trade and orderbook ticks.
* `printer` (trade handler) and `l2_handler` (orderbook handler) process tick data.
* `l2_handler` uses orderbook data (`lob` object) to submit/cancel orders based on a defined logic:
    * Determine quote price (3rd from top of book).
    * Submit orders if no pending or tighter orders exist.
    * Cancel tighter acknowledged orders.
    * Maintain time priority for duplicate levels.
    * Cancel excess orders (more than 5 on each side).
* `l2_handler` computes various market making variables (inventory, quote imbalance, mid price, vamp, vol).
* The example shows how to use `oms.limit_order` and `oms.cancel_order` to manage orders.
* The tutorial concludes by showing example quotes on the Bybit platform.

<pre tabindex="0"><code>* ColPali uses a vision-capable language model (PaliGemma) for document retrieval, surpassing traditional text-based methods.
* It leverages contextualized vision embeddings from a VLM and a late interaction similarity function (MaxSim).
* MaxSim compares query and document embeddings at query time, allowing interaction between image grid cell vectors and query text token vectors.
*  ColPali generates embeddings directly from images, eliminating the need for text extraction, OCR, and layout analysis.
*  A PDF page is represented by 1030 128-dimensional vectors (1024 image grid patches + 6 instruction tokens).
* Query text is tokenized and represented in the same 128-dimensional vector space.
* MaxSim is a dot product followed by max and sum reductions.  It can be expressed in Vespa&#39;s schema language and PyTorch.
* Scaling MaxSim involves reducing query tokens, patch vectors, or vector dimensionality.
* Hamming distance, a faster alternative to dot product, is used with binary quantization (BQ) to convert float vectors to 16-dim int8 tensors.
*  Hamming-based MaxSim is approximately 3.5 times faster than the float dot product version.
* Vespa&#39;s phased retrieval and ranking pipeline is used for scaling to billions of documents.
* Approximate nearest neighbor search retrieves candidate documents, followed by MaxSim ranking.
* Vespa supports multi-vector HNSW indexing with hamming distance for efficient nearest neighbor search.
*  A single Vespa query performs candidate selection and ranking, avoiding large data transfers between services.
* Query token pruning can further speed up retrieval by using a subset of query token vectors.
*  Evaluating ColPali on the DocVQA dataset shows that the hamming-based MaxSim achieves comparable accuracy while offering significant efficiency gains (32x storage reduction and 4x speedup).

<pre tabindex="0"><code>* ColPali is a new approach to PDF retrieval that uses vision language models (VLMs) to directly embed screenshots of PDF pages, eliminating the need for complex text extraction and preprocessing steps.
* Unlike traditional text-based retrieval models, ColPali leverages the visual content of the PDF pages, including images, tables, and charts.
* The ColPali model is based on ColBERT and PaliGemma, a powerful visual language model.  It uses multi-vector representations and late-interaction scoring for improved retrieval performance.
* ColPali significantly outperforms traditional text-based models like BM25 and BGE-M3 on the newly introduced Visual Document Retrieval (ViDoRe) benchmark.
* ColPali embeddings can be efficiently represented and used in Vespa using its tensor framework, enabling late-interaction scoring similar to ColBERT.  Two methods for storing ColPali embeddings in Vespa are described: one page per document and one PDF per document.
* Vespa&#39;s tensor framework and compute engine allow for efficient representation and scoring of ColPali embeddings without custom plugins.
* The blog post provides a Vespa schema and ranking profile example demonstrating how to integrate ColPali embeddings into a Vespa application.  It uses phased ranking with BM25 as the first phase and ColPali as the second.
* ColPali can be combined with other retrieval models, such as using ColPali embeddings as an additional feature in a gradient boosted decision tree (GBDT) or other models.
* A demo notebook is available showing how to use ColPali embeddings in Vespa.
* The model can be fine-tuned for different document formats (HTML, Word, etc.) and languages.
* ColPali handles multi-page documents by using an additional tensor dimension to represent the page.
* The model has approximately 3 billion parameters and uses the PaliGemma 3 base model.
* The blog post discusses interpretability of the model, allowing analysis of which parts of the page contribute most to the score.
* The blog post addresses how to evaluate the model on custom data and how image data is stored in Vespa (base64 encoding).
* The use of BM25 in the first phase of the ranking is justified by its efficiency and ability to serve as a strong baseline.  An alternative approach using only ColPali embeddings is also mentioned.

<pre tabindex="0"><code>* Vision Language Models (VLMs) learn from images and text, generating text outputs.  Large VLMs excel at zero-shot tasks and handle diverse image types.  Use cases include image captioning, visual question answering, and document understanding. Some can identify spatial properties and output bounding boxes or segmentation masks.

* Open-source VLMs are available on the Hugging Face Hub, with varying model sizes, image resolutions, and capabilities (e.g., chat, grounding).  Models are primarily English-trained unless otherwise noted.  Examples include LLaVA, DeepSeek-VL, moondream2, CogVLM, Fuyu-8B, KOSMOS-2, Qwen-VL, and Yi-VL-34B.

* Selecting the right VLM involves considering factors like intended use case and performance metrics.  Leaderboards like Vision Arena and Open VLM Leaderboard rank models based on user preferences and various metrics.  The VLMEvalKit and LMMS-Eval toolkits facilitate benchmarking.

* Benchmarks for evaluating VLMs include MMMU (comprehensive, multi-disciplinary), MMBench (single-choice questions across various skills), MathVista, AI2D, ScienceQA, and OCRBench.

* VLMs typically consist of an image encoder, an embedding projector, and a text decoder. Training methods vary; some freeze parts of the model (like LLaVA) while others train end-to-end (like KOSMOS-2).  Fuyu-8B uses a different approach, feeding image patches directly to a projection layer.

* Using VLMs with `transformers` involves initializing a model and processor, processing image and text prompts, generating output using the `generate` function, and decoding the output tokens.

* Fine-tuning VLMs with TRL&#39;s `SFTTrainer` is supported.  An example uses the `llava-instruct` dataset for instruction fine-tuning on a LLaVA 1.5 VLM.  This requires installing the latest version of TRL.  A data collator combines text and image pairs for training.

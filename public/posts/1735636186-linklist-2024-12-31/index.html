<p>This article discusses the latest updates to Google&rsquo;s Gemini AI model, specifically Gemini 2.0 Flash. The author is excited about the new features and capabilities of this version, which includes:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Improved spatial understanding</strong>: The model can now return bounding boxes around objects in images, even for complex photographs.</li>
<li><strong>Code execution</strong>: The model can write and execute Python code, running it and considering the result as part of its response.</li>
<li><strong>Streaming API</strong>: A new two-way stream allows for real-time audio and video input, with text and audio output in return.</li>
</ol>
<p>The author is impressed by these features and believes they are &ldquo;straight out of science fiction.&rdquo; They also note that OpenAI&rsquo;s WebSocket streaming API was released recently, but it only handles audio and is currently expensive to use.</p>
<p>Some things to look forward to include:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Multi-modal image output</strong>: Models will be able to do fine-grained image editing, which has been a long-term goal for diffusion-based image models.</li>
<li><strong>Native audio output</strong>: Gemini 2.0 Flash will be able to produce high-quality audio output with different voices, intonations, languages, and accents.</li>
</ol>
<p>The author also shares some thoughts on the potential applications of these features, such as:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Conversational AI</strong>: Being able to have an audio conversation with a capable LLM about things that it can &ldquo;see&rdquo; through your camera is a powerful tool.</li>
<li><strong>Advertising</strong>: The ability to serve targeted ads based on voice recognition and other forms of surveillance raises concerns.</li>

* Tldraw uses the Gemini API to bring conversational AI to visual programming, allowing users to generate content and process information using natural language.
* Opens up exciting opportunities for more intuitive and efficient user experience around AI, pushing the boundaries of visual communication.
* The Vision Behind Computer
* Striving to make diagramming accessible and intuitive, tldraw envisioned a more natural way for users to interact with their canvas.
* Founder Steve Ruiz sought to leverage the power of tldraw’s infinite canvas SDK to create a dynamic environment for working with generative AI.
* This vision led to the development of computer, an experimental application where users create workflows from blocks of text, images, and instructions.
* When run, information flows from one component to the next, creating powerful processes that branch, loop, and iterate to produce outputs.
* Building with Gemini 2.0: A Deep Dive into Computer
* Tldraw’s computer is built upon a network of interconnected “components” representing elements on the canvas (text boxes, images, audio clips, etc.).
* These components are linked by arrows, visualizing the flow of data and transformations.
* Each component has associated &#34;procedures&#34;—sets of instructions executed based on inputs from connected components.
* A component can accept data from any number of other components and pass its output data to many other components—including itself!
* This component-based architecture, combined with the power and speed of Gemini 2.0 Flash, allows for a fast and flexible system capable of handling diverse tasks.
* Lightning-Fast Procedure Execution: Gemini 2.0 Flash executes procedures rapidly, enabling rapid generation of scripts and outputs.
* Lots of Context, Many Modes: The maximalist bent in tldraw’s computer called for speed, capacity, and capability, making use of Gemini 2.0 Flash’s large context window.
* Structured Data: The flow of data between components relies on adherence to a single schema, ensuring efficient execution and preventing stalls.
* Dynamic Procedure Generation: Gemini 2.0 Flash can generate procedures dynamically, unlocking tremendous potential for innovative user experiences and streamlined workflows.
* A Quick Win for Innovation
* Tldraw’s quick implementation of computer highlights Gemini’s value proposition for startups: rapid prototyping, enhanced user experience through intuitive natural language interfaces, and efficient structured data handling.
* Empower Your Application with the Gemini API
* The Gemini API offers powerful models like Gemini 1.5 Pro, Gemini 1.5 Flash, and now Gemini 2.0 Flash as an experimental preview model to bring innovative AI features to your application.
* Explore the Gemini API documentation and empower your users with AI for creative professionals, developers, and teams of all kinds.

<pre tabindex="0"><code>- Structured outputs are available in Ollama, allowing models&#39; outputs to be constrained to a specific format defined by a JSON schema.
- The Ollama Python and JavaScript libraries have been updated to support structured outputs.

- Use cases include:
    - Parsing data from documents
    - Extracting data from images
    - Structuring all language model responses
    - More reliability and consistency than JSON mode

- Tips for reliable use of structured outputs include:
    - Using Pydantic (Python) or Zod (JavaScript) to define the schema for the response
    - Adding “return as JSON” to the prompt to help the model understand the request
    - Setting the temperature to 0 for more deterministic output

- Future plans include:
    - Exposing logits for controlled generation
    - Performance and accuracy improvements for structured outputs
    - GPU acceleration for sampling
    - Additional format support beyond JSON schema

<pre tabindex="0"><code>* Codecs for encoding arbitrary state trees into URL parameters and back again.
* A codec is a portmanteau of &#34;encoder&#34; and &#34;decoder&#34;, traditionally used in data streams, but now applied to encoding/disencoding discrete JavaScript application states to/from URL parameters.
* Focus on core challenges:
    - Encoding complex objects
    - Omitting values unchanged from their defaults
    - Compressing them as URL-safe strings
    - Type safety
    - Robust and helpful error handling
    - Avoid tight coupling with state management libraries/architectures/reactivity models
    - Modularizing value codecs for importability
    - Minimizing runtime dependencies
    - Versioning build metadata
* Design an API that results in easy-to-read code.
* Example usage:
    - Defining default and new states
    - Encoding changes as URL parameters
    - Decoding complete state tree with default values supplied where corresponding URL parameters are omitted
* Integration with state management libraries:
    - Using a subscriber to synchronize updates to the application state with URL parameters
    - Merging decoded state into current application state
* Additional features:
    - Encoding and decoding deeply nested values
    - ISO 8601 dates
    - Booleans
    - Entire objects as base64 strings
    - NaN handling
    - Nullable values
* Guidelines for contributing:
    - File an issue before opening a PR
    - Discuss significant changes with maintainers first
    - Maintain high level of type safety
    - Ensure unit tests pass and new code is reasonably covered by tests

<pre tabindex="0"><code>* Arbitrage betting involves locking in a win or avoiding a loss by betting on all possible outcomes of an event with different bookmakers, taking advantage of differences in odds.
* Guaranteed profit isn&#39;t always possible, but avoiding losses is.
* An example:
  * Betting $1 on Team A (SportsBet) yields $1.9 if Team A wins ($0.9 net profit).
  * Betting $1 on Team B (SportsBet) yields $1.8 if Team B wins ($0.8 net profit).
  * Betting on both teams results in a loss.
* Adding a second bookmaker:
  * Book keeper 1: Team A 1.9, Team B 1.8
  * Book keeper 2: Team A 1.4, Team B 2.5
  * Arbitrage betting $6 on Team A (Book 1) and $4 on Team B (Book 2).
* The script helps find arbitrage opportunities and calculates how much to bet.
* Inputs:
  * Odds for all outcomes
  * Optional bookmaker names (default assigned)
* Covers all outcomes for all bookmakers in the input.
* Sets capital (default is $50, can be changed by tweaking MAX_CAPITAL variable).
* Calculates zero-risk bets with different stakes and winnings.

<pre tabindex="0"><code>* Konfig was a developer tools startup focused on making API integrations easier
* We started in late 2022 with the mission of simplifying how developers work with APIs by providing better tooling around SDK generation, documentation, and testing
* Our main product was an SDK Generator that could take any OpenAPI specification and generate high-quality client libraries in multiple programming languages
* We expanded this with additional tools for API documentation and interactive API testing environments
* We gained some traction with some startups, but weren&#39;t able to build a hyper-growth business due to difficulties in getting customers to sign contracts and price points being too low
* We pivoted into a vertical B2B SaaS AI product, but didn&#39;t find enough traction to make it successful
* Despite the outcome, we&#39;re proud of the technology we built and believe our work could be helpful for others
* We&#39;re open-sourcing our entire codebase on public GitHub repo
* The codebase is being released exactly as it was when we shut down—no cleanup, no polishing, no modifications
* In the past 3 years, we built 4 main products and lots of miscellaneous things
* Lots of miscellaneous things include render.yaml
* I want to express my deepest gratitude to everyone who supported us on this journey
* Investors who believed in our vision and backed us financially are thanked
* Customers who trusted us with their business and provided invaluable feedback are thanked
* Teammates Eddie and Anh-Tuan are thanked for their dedication, hard work, and partnership through all the ups and downs
* Looking back on the startup journey, there are no regrets about leaving a job to pursue it full-time
* The experience has been transformative and taught more than success ever could
* As for what&#39;s next, I&#39;m excited to explore new opportunities, see where the job market thinks I fit, and continue learning and growing
* Maybe someday I&#39;ll take another shot at building something of my own

<p>This text appears to be an analysis and critique of the current state of artificial intelligence (AI) research and development, particularly in the area of large language models (LLMs). The author argues that the focus on scaling up model size and computing power has led to a misleading narrative about the progress of AI, and that this approach is unlikely to lead to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).</p>
<p>Here are some key points made by the author:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Scaling is not the only factor in AI progress</strong>: The author argues that emergent capabilities based solely on scaling are largely a myth, and that true progress in AI requires understanding the underlying mechanisms and modeling more complex problems.</li>
<li><strong>Human intervention is not a substitute for genuine progress</strong>: The author notes that relying on human intervention (e.g., large teams of poorly paid science students) to compensate for shortcomings is not a viable path toward AGI.</li>
<li><strong>The focus on scaling has led to overemphasis on trivial progress</strong>: The author argues that the focus on scaling up model size and computing power has led to an overemphasis on trivial progress, rather than addressing more significant challenges in AI research.</li>
<li><strong>Regulation based on arbitrary training compute thresholds is problematic</strong>: The author notes that relying on arbitrary thresholds for regulating AI research (e.g., based on computing power) is problematic and unfair to small companies, startups, and academic researchers.</li>
<li><strong>The future of AI depends on a broader understanding of the field</strong>: The author argues that the future of AI requires a more nuanced understanding of the field, including the development of new models, algorithms, and techniques for addressing complex problems.</li>
</ol>
<p>Some of the key points made by critics of the current state of AI research include:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Lack of transparency and accountability</strong>: Some critics argue that there is a lack of transparency and accountability in AI research, particularly with regards to the use of computing resources.</li>
<li><strong>Overemphasis on metrics</strong>: The author notes that many researchers focus too heavily on metrics such as accuracy and F1-score, rather than considering more nuanced measures of success (e.g., safety, interpretability).</li>
<li><strong>Insufficient consideration of downstream impacts</strong>: Some critics argue that AI research often neglects the potential downstream impacts of AI systems on society.</li>
</ol>
<p>Overall, this text presents a critical perspective on the current state of AI research and development, highlighting the need for a more nuanced understanding of the field and a broader approach to addressing complex problems.</p>

<p>The article provides an overview of a risk-managed trading strategy that aims to participate in strong trends with outsized position sizes while minimizing regret if the trend fizzes out prematurely. The key elements of this strategy include:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Tight stop losses</strong>: Using tight stop losses to limit potential losses to around 1% of capital or less.</li>
<li><strong>Entry setup with an edge</strong>: Identifying entry points with a clear edge, such as a strong trend or a well-defined technical setup.</li>
<li><strong>Laser-focused position sizing</strong>: Using large position sizes to capture outsized profits while minimizing risk.</li>
<li><strong>Risk management as the secret sauce</strong>: Recognizing that risk management is the key to making many momentum-based trading styles successful.</li>
</ol>
<p>The article also provides an example of how this strategy can be implemented in practice, using a hypothetical trade involving Bitcoin. The trade involves:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Multiple entries</strong>: Entering multiple positions at different levels, with each entry having a smaller stop loss than the previous one.</li>
<li><strong>Trailing stops</strong>: Trailing stops to lock in profits and limit potential losses.</li>
<li><strong>Position sizing</strong>: Using large position sizes to capture outsized profits while minimizing risk.</li>
</ol>
<p>The article concludes that this strategy is well-suited for investors who want to participate in strong trends with outsized returns, but are willing to take on some level of risk. It also notes that the key to success lies in managing risk effectively and being prepared to adapt to changing market conditions.</p>
<p>Overall, the article provides a clear and concise overview of a risk-managed trading strategy that aims to capture outsized profits while minimizing regret.</p>

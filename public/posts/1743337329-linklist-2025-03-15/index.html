Here&#39;s a summary of the key points: **General Principles** 1. **Customer First**: Prioritize customer needs and provide support for all features in paid tiers, regardless of their license level. 2. **Developer-First**: Focus on solving problems for developers first, then adapt to other personas (e.g., operations, security) while maintaining a developer-centric approach. 3. **Cloud-Native First**: Build features for cloud-native first and then support the rest, focusing on modern development flows and architectures. **Feature Naming** 1. Use prepositions when referring to third-party products and services in names (e.g., &#34;GitLab.com for Jira Cloud&#34;). 2. Prioritize complete maturity for developers building cloud-native applications before moving to other development methodologies and personas. 3. Use a &#34;modern first&#34; approach, solving problems for modern development teams before addressing legacy teams. **Prioritization** 1. Focus on next-generation development flows, personas, and use cases, even if they&#39;re not currently adopted by your initial users. 2. Optimize GitLab to support the larger number of current and future adopters of next-generation principles. 3. Clearly communicate with users what the preferred path is and ensure that legacy methods are deprecated. **Core Values** 1. **Stewardship**: Ensure that no feature is removed from Core into paid tiers, but can build additional features around existing ones for paying customers only. 2. **Preparation**: Plan ahead and invest in modern workflows and architectures to support the future needs of your users. 3. **Adaptability**: Be willing to adapt and evolve based on user feedback and changing market conditions. **Guidelines** 1. Use prepositions when naming features that integrate with third-party products or services (e.g., &#34;GitLab for Slack&#34;). 2. Avoid using internal terminology or acronyms when referring to external products or services. 3. Document all changes, deprecations, and additions to features in a clear and concise manner. Overall, this document outlines a set of guidelines and principles that aim to ensure the long-term success and growth of the GitLab platform. By prioritizing customer needs, developer-centricity, cloud-native first development, and continuous improvement, GitLab can maintain its position as a leader in the DevOps and software development space. https://www.engines.dev/blog/code-navigation#stack-graphs * tl;dr: We explored various approaches to code navigation for AI SWEs and share our findings on what works and what doesn&#39;t. * We&#39;re building the best platform to run AI SWEs with a purpose-built code navigation system. * Current research approaches include: - SWE-Agent - CodeMonkey - Moatless * Our approach is similar to OpenHands, exposing tools for finding all references and going to definition. * Our vision for code navigation includes: - Scalability - Incremental indexing - Flexibility - Permissively licensed * We explored different systems, including: - lsproxy (purpose-built LSP library) - Stack Graphs (advanced data structure) - Pros: incremental, theoretically language agnostic, fast queries - Cons: limited support for languages, complex files required - Glean (production code indexing system at Meta) - Pros: incremental, scalable, flexible, can navigate arbitrary commits - Cons: proprietary Thrift protocol, requires custom parser for languages - multilspy (Python library providing a convenient wrapper around LSP servers) * Our solution is to add convenience wrapping around multilspy. * Looking forward to further explorations and comparisons with the AI SWE community. * Further reading: - Nuanced.dev - CodeMonkeys https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/6/aider-using-uv-as-an-installer/ * Aider uses `pip install aider-install &amp;&amp; aider-install` to install in an isolated virtual environment. * The `aider-install` package depends on the `uv` library. * When running `aider-install`, it executes Python code that: &#43; Finds the location of the `uv` binary &#43; Installs Aider using `uv tool install` &#43; Updates the shell to include the Aider directory in the PATH * The installation process creates a new standalone copy of Python 3.12 and places it in `uv&#39;s managed directory structure. * The `--force` flag is used to overwrite any previous attempts at installing Aider. * Running `uv tool update-shell` ensures that the bin directory is on the user&#39;s PATH. * This installation method is recommended for non-expert Python users due to its minimal risk of breaking the system. * The method has significantly reduced GitHub issues related to conflicted or broken Python environments. * An alternative installation mechanism may be preferred by experienced users. https://blog.6nok.org/tailscale-is-pretty-useful/ * Tailscale is a useful tool for creating a virtual private network, allowing access to devices anywhere with domain shorthands. * It was recommended after experiencing issues with DDNS and CGNAT2, which made port forwarding impossible. * The client software needs to be installed on devices, logging in is an easy process. * Additional benefits include: * Exposing a port from laptop to phone for web application testing. * Taildrop: file transfer between devices without close proximity. * Exit nodes: appointing a machine as an exit node for VPN-like functionality. * Mullvad integration: two-tier VPN with privacy features. * Note that Tailscale is open-source, but some wrappers are not. * Headscale is an open-source server implementation compatible with Tailscale&#39;s client software. * Some links to external resources mentioned in the article: * Dynamic DNS * Carrier-grade NAT * Home theater PC * Snapdrop and Pairdrop comparison https://github.com/jlevy/chopdiff https://www.bbc.co.uk/future/article/20250304-the-countries-that-never-locked-down-for-covid-19 https://github.com/PySheets/pysheets * PySheets is a spreadsheet UI for Python, implemented in Python, running logic and saving data in the browser, using PyScript and IndexedDB. * To run PySheets without locally installing it, simply visit pysheets.app * To install and run PySheets on your local machine, run: pip install pysheets-app pysheets https://github.com/booleandilemma/hn-blacklist * Tired of seeing articles from certain sources on Hacker News?

Here&#39;s a summary of how it works: **Key Components** 1. **WireGuard**: Uncloud uses WireGuard for secure, encrypted communication between machines. 2. **Caddy**: Caddy is used as a reverse proxy and watches the cluster state for new services. 3. **uncloudd**: uncloudd is the CLI tool that communicates with uncloudd on target machines to launch containers. **How it Works** 1. Multiple machines are provisioned, each with its own subnet (e.g., `10.210.X.2-254`). 2. Machines establish a WireGuard connection with each other, creating an overlay network. 3. When a service is run using the CLI (`uc run`), uncloudd on a target machine launches a Docker container in the bridge network. 4. The container gets a cluster-unique IP address from the bridge network and becomes accessible from other machines in the cluster. 5. Caddy watches the cluster state for new services and updates its configuration to route traffic to the new container. **Benefits** 1. **Decentralized**: No need for control plane or master nodes. 2. **Fault-tolerant**: If one machine goes offline, others can still serve cluster operations. 3. **Easy maintenance**: Any machine has access to the complete cluster state and can make changes. https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02948 * Abstract: Generating high-quality question-answer pairs for specialized technical domains remains challenging, with existing approaches facing a tradeoff between leveraging expert examples and achieving topical diversity. * We present ExpertGenQA, a protocol that combines few-shot learning with structured topic and style categorization to generate comprehensive domain-specific QA pairs. * Using U.S. Federal Railroad Administration documents as a test bed, we demonstrate that ExpertGenQA achieves twice the efficiency of baseline few-shot approaches while maintaining 94.4% topic coverage. * Through systematic evaluation, we show that current LLM-based judges and reward models exhibit strong bias toward superficial writing styles rather than content quality. * Our analysis using Bloom&#39;s Taxonomy reveals that ExpertGenQA better preserves the cognitive complexity distribution of expert-written questions compared to template-based approaches. * When used to train retrieval models, our generated queries improve top-1 accuracy by 13.02% over baseline performance, demonstrating their effectiveness for downstream applications in technical domains. https://github.com/yuruotong1/autoMate * # AI-powered Local Automation Tool * ## Description * &#34;Automate the tedious, reclaim your time for life&#34; * * * autoMate is a revolutionary AI&#43;RPA automation tool built on OmniParser that can: * - Understand your needs and automatically plan tasks * - Intelligently comprehend screen content, simulating human vision and operations * - Make autonomous decisions, judging and taking actions based on task requirements * - Support local deployment to protect your data security and privacy * - No-Code Automation * - Full Interface Control * - Simplified Installation https://rivet.gg/blog/2025-02-16-sqlite-on-the-server-is-misunderstood * SQLite-on-the-Server Is Misunderstood: Better At Hyper-Scale Than Micro-Scale * We&#39;re Rivet, a new open-source, self-hostable serverless platform. * There&#39;s been a lot of discussion recently about the pros and cons of SQLite on the server. * After reading many of these conversations, I realized that my perspective on the power of SQLite-on-the-server is lopsided from popular opinion: &#43; SQLite&#39;s strengths really shine at scale, instead of with small hobbyist deployments. * Background * Why Developers Love SQLite for Micro-Scale Deployments - Low infrastructure costs: No need for separate database servers—just a single file. - Seamless development and testing: The same database file can be used across client and server. - Minimal management overhead: No complex configurations or database daemons. - Proven reliability: It&#39;s been around forever. It&#39;s the world&#39;s most widely deployed database and built to withstand battleships getting blown to bits. * Tools for SQLite-on-the-server * Enhance SQLite with replication and high availability tools like LiteFS, Litestream, rqlite, Dqlite, and Bedrock: - Specifically focusing on Cloudflare Durable Objects and Turso * Databases at Hyper-Scale Today: Sharded Databases &amp; Partitioning Keys &#43; High-scale systems struggle with scaling databases like Postgres or MySQL. &#43; Companies often turn to sharded databases like Cassandra, ScyllaDB, DynamoDB, Vitess (sharded MySQL), and Citus (sharded Postgres). - These systems use partitioning keys to co-locate related &amp; similarly structured data. * Benefits of Sharded Databases &#43; Efficient batch reads with data grouped in the same partition. &#43; Horizontal scalability by partitioning data across nodes. &#43; Optimized writes for high-ingestion workloads * Challenges with Current Partitioning Solutions &#43; Rigid schemas limiting flexibility. &#43; Complex schema changes requiring significant operational overhead. &#43; Complex cross-partition operations enforcing ACID properties is difficult. &#43; Data inconsistency without strong constraints between tables &amp; partitions. * Enter SQLite at Scale: Cloudflare Durable Objects &amp; Turso * Provide dynamic scaling, infinite cheap databases, global distribution, and built-in replication and durability: - Leverage to replace partitioning keys with SQLite database per partition * Benefits of SQLite-Per-Partition &#43; Local ACID transactions without cross-partition complexities. &#43; Efficient I/O within partitions for high performance. &#43; Leverage existing SQLite extensions and SQL migrations tools &#43; Lazy schema migrations allowing changes on demand. * Who are the Turso founders? * Founded by people who used to work at ScyllaDB and saw the challenges of large-scale partitioned databases firsthand. * Where SQLite Still Falls Short &#43; Lack of an open-source, self-hosted solution. &#43; Limited database tooling like SQL browsers, ETL pipelines, monitoring, and backups. &#43; Non-standard protocols for communicating with SQLite-on-the-server. &#43; No case studies at hyper-scale using SQLite with this architecture. https://github.com/PathOnAI/LiteWebAgent LiteWebAgent is an open-source library developed by PathOnAI that provides a framework for building web-agent applications using large language models (LLMs).

Here&#39;s a summary of how it works: **Key Components** 1. **WireGuard**: Uncloud uses WireGuard for secure, encrypted communication between machines. 2. **Caddy**: Caddy is used as a reverse proxy and watches the cluster state for new services. 3. **uncloudd**: uncloudd is the CLI tool that communicates with uncloudd on target machines to launch containers. **How it Works** 1. Multiple machines are provisioned, each with its own subnet (e.g., `10.210.X.2-254`). 2. Machines establish a WireGuard connection with each other, creating an overlay network. 3. When a service is run using the CLI (`uc run`), uncloudd on a target machine launches a Docker container in the bridge network. 4. The container gets a cluster-unique IP address from the bridge network and becomes accessible from other machines in the cluster. 5. Caddy watches the cluster state for new services and updates its configuration to route traffic to the new container. **Benefits** 1. **Decentralized**: No need for control plane or master nodes. 2. **Fault-tolerant**: If one machine goes offline, others can still serve cluster operations. 3. **Easy maintenance**: Any machine has access to the complete cluster state and can make changes. https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02948 * Abstract: Generating high-quality question-answer pairs for specialized technical domains remains challenging, with existing approaches facing a tradeoff between leveraging expert examples and achieving topical diversity. * We present ExpertGenQA, a protocol that combines few-shot learning with structured topic and style categorization to generate comprehensive domain-specific QA pairs. * Using U.S. Federal Railroad Administration documents as a test bed, we demonstrate that ExpertGenQA achieves twice the efficiency of baseline few-shot approaches while maintaining 94.4% topic coverage. * Through systematic evaluation, we show that current LLM-based judges and reward models exhibit strong bias toward superficial writing styles rather than content quality. * Our analysis using Bloom&#39;s Taxonomy reveals that ExpertGenQA better preserves the cognitive complexity distribution of expert-written questions compared to template-based approaches. * When used to train retrieval models, our generated queries improve top-1 accuracy by 13.02% over baseline performance, demonstrating their effectiveness for downstream applications in technical domains. https://github.com/yuruotong1/autoMate * # AI-powered Local Automation Tool * ## Description * &#34;Automate the tedious, reclaim your time for life&#34; * * * autoMate is a revolutionary AI&#43;RPA automation tool built on OmniParser that can: * - Understand your needs and automatically plan tasks * - Intelligently comprehend screen content, simulating human vision and operations * - Make autonomous decisions, judging and taking actions based on task requirements * - Support local deployment to protect your data security and privacy * - No-Code Automation * - Full Interface Control * - Simplified Installation https://rivet.gg/blog/2025-02-16-sqlite-on-the-server-is-misunderstood * SQLite-on-the-Server Is Misunderstood: Better At Hyper-Scale Than Micro-Scale * We&#39;re Rivet, a new open-source, self-hostable serverless platform. * There&#39;s been a lot of discussion recently about the pros and cons of SQLite on the server. * After reading many of these conversations, I realized that my perspective on the power of SQLite-on-the-server is lopsided from popular opinion: &#43; SQLite&#39;s strengths really shine at scale, instead of with small hobbyist deployments. * Background * Why Developers Love SQLite for Micro-Scale Deployments - Low infrastructure costs: No need for separate database servers—just a single file. - Seamless development and testing: The same database file can be used across client and server. - Minimal management overhead: No complex configurations or database daemons. - Proven reliability: It&#39;s been around forever. It&#39;s the world&#39;s most widely deployed database and built to withstand battleships getting blown to bits. * Tools for SQLite-on-the-server * Enhance SQLite with replication and high availability tools like LiteFS, Litestream, rqlite, Dqlite, and Bedrock: - Specifically focusing on Cloudflare Durable Objects and Turso * Databases at Hyper-Scale Today: Sharded Databases &amp; Partitioning Keys &#43; High-scale systems struggle with scaling databases like Postgres or MySQL. &#43; Companies often turn to sharded databases like Cassandra, ScyllaDB, DynamoDB, Vitess (sharded MySQL), and Citus (sharded Postgres). - These systems use partitioning keys to co-locate related &amp; similarly structured data. * Benefits of Sharded Databases &#43; Efficient batch reads with data grouped in the same partition. &#43; Horizontal scalability by partitioning data across nodes. &#43; Optimized writes for high-ingestion workloads * Challenges with Current Partitioning Solutions &#43; Rigid schemas limiting flexibility. &#43; Complex schema changes requiring significant operational overhead. &#43; Complex cross-partition operations enforcing ACID properties is difficult. &#43; Data inconsistency without strong constraints between tables &amp; partitions. * Enter SQLite at Scale: Cloudflare Durable Objects &amp; Turso * Provide dynamic scaling, infinite cheap databases, global distribution, and built-in replication and durability: - Leverage to replace partitioning keys with SQLite database per partition * Benefits of SQLite-Per-Partition &#43; Local ACID transactions without cross-partition complexities. &#43; Efficient I/O within partitions for high performance. &#43; Leverage existing SQLite extensions and SQL migrations tools &#43; Lazy schema migrations allowing changes on demand. * Who are the Turso founders? * Founded by people who used to work at ScyllaDB and saw the challenges of large-scale partitioned databases firsthand. * Where SQLite Still Falls Short &#43; Lack of an open-source, self-hosted solution. &#43; Limited database tooling like SQL browsers, ETL pipelines, monitoring, and backups. &#43; Non-standard protocols for communicating with SQLite-on-the-server. &#43; No case studies at hyper-scale using SQLite with this architecture. https://github.com/PathOnAI/LiteWebAgent LiteWebAgent is an open-source library developed by PathOnAI that provides a framework for building web-agent applications using large language models (LLMs).

Here&#39;s a summary of the key points: **The importance of readability** Readability is crucial for maintainable and efficient software development. It allows developers to quickly understand the code, fix issues, and make changes without getting bogged down in complexity. **8 patterns for improving code readability** The article identifies 8 patterns that can help improve code readability: 1. **Line/Operator/Operand count**: Break up long functions with fewer variables and operators. 2. **Novelty**: Avoid novelty in function shapes, operators, or syntactic sugars; reuse common patterns instead. 3. **Grouping**: Split series of long function chains, iterators, or comprehensions into logical groupings via helper functions or intermediate variables. 4. **Conditional simplicity**: Keep conditional tests as short as possible and prefer sequences of the same logical operator over mixing operators within a conditional. 5. **Gotos**: Use gotos only when necessary (e.g., to avoid alternatives that are worse). 6. **Nesting**: Minimize nested logic (avoid large variations in indentation) and isolate deep nesting in separate functions. 7. **Variable distinction**: Always use descriptive and visually distinct variable names; avoid variable shadowing. 8. **Variable liveness**: Prefer shorter liveness durations for variables, especially with regard to function boundaries. **Additional tips** * Reuse familiar code patterns and follow the Principle of Least Surprise when writing code. * Use templated or generic functions to reduce repetition and make code more predictable. * Avoid premature optimization; computers are fast enough. https://github.com/Tracktor/playsmart - End the never-ending game of manually recording, inspecting, and updating E2E tests with Playwright. - Playsmart is a code-first approach for automating web interactions using real-time LLM agents. - Install via pip: `pip install playsmart` (requires Python 3.10&#43;). https://github.com/codingworkflow/ai-code-fusion * - Visual directory explorer for selecting code files * - Advanced file filtering with customizable patterns * - Accurate token counting for various AI models * - Code content processing with statistics * - Cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux) https://github.com/ezyang/codemcp # Install codemcp to make Claude Desktop a pair programming assistant">

<pre tabindex="0"><code>* Markov chains are mathematical systems that hop from one &#34;state&#34; to another.
* A state space is a list of all possible states in a system.
* A Markov chain tells you the probability of hopping, or &#34;transitioning,&#34; from one state to any other state.
* Real modelers use a &#34;transition matrix&#34; to tally transition probabilities instead of drawing diagrams.
* The number of cells in a transition matrix grows quadratically as you add states to your Markov chain.
* One use of Markov chains is to include real-world phenomena in computer simulations.
* A two-state Markov chain can mimic the &#34;stickyness&#34; of real-world data, such as weather patterns.
* Markov chains are used by meteorologists, ecologists, computer scientists, and financial engineers to model big phenomena.
* Examples of Markov chains include PageRank algorithm used by Google and customizable Markov chains in a playground.
* You can access more examples and explanations at setosa.io/markov or visit the Explained Visually project homepage.

<pre tabindex="0"><code>* In payments engineering, it&#39;s essential to have an architecture that facilitates easy and accurate money movement functions with domain awareness for long-term scalability and regulatory compliance in mind.
* Best practices include:
    + Log every event (request - response calls) and use a state-machine on top of this database to access the latest state.
    + Build a double entry ledger (reconciliation daily EOD).
    + Always store money in integer format (in cents), not float ($ in decimal).
    + Ensure idempotency for consistent responses.
* Audited financials require immutable and double entry ledgers.
* A Payments PM should map out all events triggering a payment capture() call to ensure consistency.
* Understanding your codebase and state machine is crucial for architecting a good payments engineering platform.
* Best practices include:
    + Using microservices architecture to avoid spaghetti code.
    + Having a consistent approach when displaying pricing on product SKUs or in the cart.
    + Optimistic locking (tx_id, event#) on database logs.
    + Maintaining an immutable ledger and a transaction state machine for auditing.
* Data engineering and Data Science use the state machine&#39;s latest state for analysis.
* Always store money in cents for calculations to avoid inconsistencies.
* Use AWS instead of internal datastores for industry-guaranteed reliability.
* Immutable ledgers are essential for audited financials.
* Consider mapping out events triggering a payment capture() call for consistency.

<pre tabindex="0"><code>This document outlines a set of principles and guidelines for developing and maintaining the GitLab platform. Here&#39;s a summary of the key points:

**General Principles**

1. **Customer First**: Prioritize customer needs and provide support for all features in paid tiers, regardless of their license level.
2. **Developer-First**: Focus on solving problems for developers first, then adapt to other personas (e.g., operations, security) while maintaining a developer-centric approach.
3. **Cloud-Native First**: Build features for cloud-native first and then support the rest, focusing on modern development flows and architectures.

**Feature Naming**

1. Use prepositions when referring to third-party products and services in names (e.g., &#34;GitLab.com for Jira Cloud&#34;).
2. Prioritize complete maturity for developers building cloud-native applications before moving to other development methodologies and personas.
3. Use a &#34;modern first&#34; approach, solving problems for modern development teams before addressing legacy teams.

**Prioritization**

1. Focus on next-generation development flows, personas, and use cases, even if they&#39;re not currently adopted by your initial users.
2. Optimize GitLab to support the larger number of current and future adopters of next-generation principles.
3. Clearly communicate with users what the preferred path is and ensure that legacy methods are deprecated.

**Core Values**

1. **Stewardship**: Ensure that no feature is removed from Core into paid tiers, but can build additional features around existing ones for paying customers only.
2. **Preparation**: Plan ahead and invest in modern workflows and architectures to support the future needs of your users.
3. **Adaptability**: Be willing to adapt and evolve based on user feedback and changing market conditions.

**Guidelines**

1. Use prepositions when naming features that integrate with third-party products or services (e.g., &#34;GitLab for Slack&#34;).
2. Avoid using internal terminology or acronyms when referring to external products or services.
3. Document all changes, deprecations, and additions to features in a clear and concise manner.

Overall, this document outlines a set of guidelines and principles that aim to ensure the long-term success and growth of the GitLab platform. By prioritizing customer needs, developer-centricity, cloud-native first development, and continuous improvement, GitLab can maintain its position as a leader in the DevOps and software development space.

* Our vision for code navigation includes:
    - Scalability
    - Incremental indexing
    - Flexibility
    - Permissively licensed
* We explored different systems, including:
    - lsproxy (purpose-built LSP library)
    - Stack Graphs (advanced data structure)
        - Pros: incremental, theoretically language agnostic, fast queries
        - Cons: limited support for languages, complex files required
    - Glean (production code indexing system at Meta)
        - Pros: incremental, scalable, flexible, can navigate arbitrary commits
        - Cons: proprietary Thrift protocol, requires custom parser for languages
    - multilspy (Python library providing a convenient wrapper around LSP servers)
* Our solution is to add convenience wrapping around multilspy.
* Looking forward to further explorations and comparisons with the AI SWE community.

<pre tabindex="0"><code>* Aider uses `pip install aider-install &amp;&amp; aider-install` to install in an isolated virtual environment.
* The `aider-install` package depends on the `uv` library.
* When running `aider-install`, it executes Python code that:
    + Finds the location of the `uv` binary
    + Installs Aider using `uv tool install`
    + Updates the shell to include the Aider directory in the PATH
* The installation process creates a new standalone copy of Python 3.12 and places it in `uv&#39;s managed directory structure.
* The `--force` flag is used to overwrite any previous attempts at installing Aider.
* Running `uv tool update-shell` ensures that the bin directory is on the user&#39;s PATH.

<pre tabindex="0"><code>This text describes a new networking system called &#34;Uncloud&#34; that allows multiple machines to work together without a centralized control plane or master nodes. Here&#39;s a summary of how it works:

**Key Components**

1. **WireGuard**: Uncloud uses WireGuard for secure, encrypted communication between machines.
2. **Caddy**: Caddy is used as a reverse proxy and watches the cluster state for new services.
3. **uncloudd**: uncloudd is the CLI tool that communicates with uncloudd on target machines to launch containers.

**How it Works**

1. Multiple machines are provisioned, each with its own subnet (e.g., `10.210.X.2-254`).
2. Machines establish a WireGuard connection with each other, creating an overlay network.
3. When a service is run using the CLI (`uc run`), uncloudd on a target machine launches a Docker container in the bridge network.
4. The container gets a cluster-unique IP address from the bridge network and becomes accessible from other machines in the cluster.
5. Caddy watches the cluster state for new services and updates its configuration to route traffic to the new container.

**Benefits**

1. **Decentralized**: No need for control plane or master nodes.
2. **Fault-tolerant**: If one machine goes offline, others can still serve cluster operations.
3. **Easy maintenance**: Any machine has access to the complete cluster state and can make changes.

* Using U.S. Federal Railroad Administration documents as a test bed, we demonstrate that ExpertGenQA achieves twice the efficiency of baseline few-shot approaches while maintaining 94.4% topic coverage.
* Through systematic evaluation, we show that current LLM-based judges and reward models exhibit strong bias toward superficial writing styles rather than content quality.
* Our analysis using Bloom&#39;s Taxonomy reveals that ExpertGenQA better preserves the cognitive complexity distribution of expert-written questions compared to template-based approaches.
* When used to train retrieval models, our generated queries improve top-1 accuracy by 13.02% over baseline performance, demonstrating their effectiveness for downstream applications in technical domains.

<pre tabindex="0"><code>* SQLite-on-the-Server Is Misunderstood: Better At Hyper-Scale Than Micro-Scale
* We&#39;re Rivet, a new open-source, self-hostable serverless platform. 
* There&#39;s been a lot of discussion recently about the pros and cons of SQLite on the server.
* After reading many of these conversations, I realized that my perspective on the power of SQLite-on-the-server is lopsided from popular opinion:
  + SQLite&#39;s strengths really shine at scale, instead of with small hobbyist deployments.
* Background
  * Why Developers Love SQLite for Micro-Scale Deployments
    - Low infrastructure costs: No need for separate database servers—just a single file.
    - Seamless development and testing: The same database file can be used across client and server.
    - Minimal management overhead: No complex configurations or database daemons.
    - Proven reliability: It&#39;s been around forever. It&#39;s the world&#39;s most widely deployed database and built to withstand battleships getting blown to bits.
* Tools for SQLite-on-the-server
  * Enhance SQLite with replication and high availability tools like LiteFS, Litestream, rqlite, Dqlite, and Bedrock:
    - Specifically focusing on Cloudflare Durable Objects and Turso
* Databases at Hyper-Scale Today: Sharded Databases &amp; Partitioning Keys
  + High-scale systems struggle with scaling databases like Postgres or MySQL.
  + Companies often turn to sharded databases like Cassandra, ScyllaDB, DynamoDB, Vitess (sharded MySQL), and Citus (sharded Postgres).
    - These systems use partitioning keys to co-locate related &amp; similarly structured data.
* Benefits of Sharded Databases
  + Efficient batch reads with data grouped in the same partition.
  + Horizontal scalability by partitioning data across nodes.
  + Optimized writes for high-ingestion workloads
* Challenges with Current Partitioning Solutions
  + Rigid schemas limiting flexibility.
  + Complex schema changes requiring significant operational overhead.
  + Complex cross-partition operations enforcing ACID properties is difficult.
  + Data inconsistency without strong constraints between tables &amp; partitions.
* Enter SQLite at Scale: Cloudflare Durable Objects &amp; Turso
  * Provide dynamic scaling, infinite cheap databases, global distribution, and built-in replication and durability:
    - Leverage to replace partitioning keys with SQLite database per partition
* Benefits of SQLite-Per-Partition
  + Local ACID transactions without cross-partition complexities.
  + Efficient I/O within partitions for high performance.
  + Leverage existing SQLite extensions and SQL migrations tools
  + Lazy schema migrations allowing changes on demand.
* Who are the Turso founders?
  * Founded by people who used to work at ScyllaDB and saw the challenges of large-scale partitioned databases firsthand.
* Where SQLite Still Falls Short
  + Lack of an open-source, self-hosted solution.
  + Limited database tooling like SQL browsers, ETL pipelines, monitoring, and backups.
  + Non-standard protocols for communicating with SQLite-on-the-server.
  + No case studies at hyper-scale using SQLite with this architecture.

**The importance of readability**

Readability is crucial for maintainable and efficient software development. It allows developers to quickly understand the code, fix issues, and make changes without getting bogged down in complexity.

**8 patterns for improving code readability**

The article identifies 8 patterns that can help improve code readability:

1. **Line/Operator/Operand count**: Break up long functions with fewer variables and operators.
2. **Novelty**: Avoid novelty in function shapes, operators, or syntactic sugars; reuse common patterns instead.
3. **Grouping**: Split series of long function chains, iterators, or comprehensions into logical groupings via helper functions or intermediate variables.
4. **Conditional simplicity**: Keep conditional tests as short as possible and prefer sequences of the same logical operator over mixing operators within a conditional.
5. **Gotos**: Use gotos only when necessary (e.g., to avoid alternatives that are worse).
6. **Nesting**: Minimize nested logic (avoid large variations in indentation) and isolate deep nesting in separate functions.
7. **Variable distinction**: Always use descriptive and visually distinct variable names; avoid variable shadowing.
8. **Variable liveness**: Prefer shorter liveness durations for variables, especially with regard to function boundaries.

**Additional tips**

* Reuse familiar code patterns and follow the Principle of Least Surprise when writing code.
* Use templated or generic functions to reduce repetition and make code more predictable.
* Avoid premature optimization; computers are fast enough.

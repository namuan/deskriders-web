This friction is our wedge.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here are three actionable opportunities extracted from our Agentic SDLC notes, along with realistic product concepts that could be prototyped within 60–90 days.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It is a byproduct.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Historically, the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) was designed to manage human limitations: typing speed, cognitive load, and communication overhead. Code was treated as a scarce, expensive asset. With the integration of AI coding assistants (e.g., GitHub Copilot) and autonomous terminal agents (e.g., Aider), code is now a highly commoditized byproduct of specifications.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

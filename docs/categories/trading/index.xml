      <description>Hypothesis: What if we avoid new trade if RSI is overbought or oversold?
Backtest with different RSI thresholds and different RSI periods
RSI Thresholds:
RSI Period: 4 rsi_low_values=(0 10 20 30) rsi_high_values=(70 80 90 100) Best Parameters by Expectancy Ratio:
rsi_low_threshold=20, rsi_high_threshold=100
Expectancy Ratio: 1.08
This combination shows the highest expectancy ratio, indicating it provides the best risk-adjusted returns. rsi_low_threshold=30, rsi_high_threshold=100
Expectancy Ratio: 1.06
Second-best expectancy ratio. rsi_low_threshold=30, rsi_high_threshold=70
Expectancy Ratio: 1.</description>

      <description>Summary from this tweet from Laurens Bensdorp
Here&amp;rsquo;s what seems to matter most:
Core Performance Metrics: CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and its variants CAGR/UI (Ulcer Index) ratio CAGR/MaxDD (Maximum Drawdown) Some use RAR (Risk-Adjusted Return) instead of CAGR for more date-independent analysis Risk Management Metrics: Maximum Drawdown Average Exposure (particularly important for mean reversion strategies) Drawdown Correlation Total Drawdown Ulcer Index Trade Quality Indicators: Profit Factor Expectancy System Quality Number (SQN) Win Ratio Standard Deviation of Returns Coefficient of Variation Strategy-Specific Considerations: For Stocks: Individual trade statistics Capital utilization efficiency Average capital use per trade For Futures: Risk metrics Drawdown analysis Trend gain patterns Advanced Analysis: Walk-forward testing results consistency Performance during &amp;ldquo;black swan&amp;rdquo; events (1987 crash, flash crashes) Stagnation periods Monthly Return on Risk (RoR) Monthly dollar performance Evaluation Method Tip: Some traders use conditional formatting with color ranking to aggregate multiple metrics, helping identify top-performing systems more easily.</description>

      <description>Gather data The Options data is retrieved from optionsdx. This page documents the field definitions
The downloaded files will be zipped, so extract them into a single directory. It&amp;rsquo;ll look something like this:
Import data Use the optionsdx-data-importer.py script to import all the data in an SQLite database
$ uvr optionsdx-data-importer.py --input $(pwd)/data/spy_eod --output data/spy_eod.db -v The finished database will have an options_data table with all the data from the downloaded files.</description>

      <description>Came across this reddit post about asking for recommendations where the stock could go at least 2x in 1 to 3 years. I thought it would be interesting to track the recommendations and come back in 1 to 3 years and see how they perform.

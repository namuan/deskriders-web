      <description>Here is a brief recap of the workflow I use to collect links to read later.
It starts with a &amp;ldquo;Shortcut,&amp;rdquo; which is available on all iOS/Mac devices.
It is either something I want to read today:
Or push it back to tomorrow:
The links end up in a separate &amp;ldquo;Reminders&amp;rdquo; list, which makes it easy to manage.
Using Reminders as a way to organize reading links is quite useful, as it nags you at regular intervals.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m amazed by Google&amp;rsquo;s Notebook LLM
&amp;ldquo;NotebookLM gives you a personalized AI collaborator that helps you do your best thinking. After uploading your documents, NotebookLM becomes an instant expert in those sources so you can read, take notes, and collaborate with it to refine and organize your ideas.&amp;rdquo;

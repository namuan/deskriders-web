      <description>Here is a brief recap of the workflow I use to collect links to read later.
It starts with a &amp;ldquo;Shortcut,&amp;rdquo; which is available on all iOS/Mac devices.
It is either something I want to read today:
Or push it back to tomorrow:
The links end up in a separate &amp;ldquo;Reminders&amp;rdquo; list, which makes it easy to manage.
Using Reminders as a way to organize reading links is quite useful, as it nags you at regular intervals.</description>

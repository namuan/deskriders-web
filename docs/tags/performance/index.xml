      <description>Summary from this tweet from Laurens Bensdorp
Here&amp;rsquo;s what seems to matter most:
Core Performance Metrics: CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and its variants CAGR/UI (Ulcer Index) ratio CAGR/MaxDD (Maximum Drawdown) Some use RAR (Risk-Adjusted Return) instead of CAGR for more date-independent analysis Risk Management Metrics: Maximum Drawdown Average Exposure (particularly important for mean reversion strategies) Drawdown Correlation Total Drawdown Ulcer Index Trade Quality Indicators: Profit Factor Expectancy System Quality Number (SQN) Win Ratio Standard Deviation of Returns Coefficient of Variation Strategy-Specific Considerations: For Stocks: Individual trade statistics Capital utilization efficiency Average capital use per trade For Futures: Risk metrics Drawdown analysis Trend gain patterns Advanced Analysis: Walk-forward testing results consistency Performance during &amp;ldquo;black swan&amp;rdquo; events (1987 crash, flash crashes) Stagnation periods Monthly Return on Risk (RoR) Monthly dollar performance Evaluation Method Tip: Some traders use conditional formatting with color ranking to aggregate multiple metrics, helping identify top-performing systems more easily.</description>

      <description>I selected IYR (as Real Estate proxy) and SPY and compare them over the last 24 years. This is expected but surprising to see the performance from 2001 - to date.
As seen in the bottom chart, the stock market just managed to rise above the Real Estate returns.
SPY (571%) vs IYR (549%)
But the picture changes if we start a little later. Here is the comparison every 4 years from 2001.</description>

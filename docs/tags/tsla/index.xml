      <description>Last Thursday, TSLA jumped around 20% after the earnings call.
I think there may be an opportunity for a trade due to this extreme movement. So I looked into the number of times when there was a significant jump and then what happened afterwards.
There are around 9 occasions where TSLA jumped more than 15% in a day, including the one that happened last week.

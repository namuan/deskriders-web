</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">*</span>   - Leveraging Python&#39;s asynchronous programming capabilities for non-blocking I/O operations with libraries like aio boto3 and httpx.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">*</span>   - Optimizing read patterns by batching ScyllaDB queries into single requests to minimize network round-trips and prevent event loop stalls.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">*</span>   - Minimizing data validation overhead using dataclasses instead of Pydantic models, especially when working with large volumes of data.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">*</span>   - Improving garbage collection efficiency by fine-tuning Python&#39;s memory management settings for high-throughput applications.

<pre tabindex="0"><code>* # Building Reliable Agentic Systems: Part I
*  *There’s always been a gap between demo and realistic application.*
*  *With Gen AI, it has widened to a gulf.*
*  *Agent demos accompanied by exaggerated claims are plentiful. Yet agentic success stories are thin on the ground, at least in enterprise.*
*  *We can bridge the gap between promise and reality by applying what we’ve learnt about software engineering over time.*
*   *Some things don’t change.*
*   # Travel Planner Functionality
*   *Tripper is a journey planner, originally created to plan a road trip for myself and my girlfriend.*
*   *Given start and destination and desired dates, information about the travelers and a travel brief, it builds a personalized day to day plan.*
*   *It suggests activities, chooses places to stay and searches Airbnb for each location.*
*   # Supporting Services
*   *Generating this quality of output requires not just LLMs, but multiple integrations.*
*   *The supporting cast:*
*     - Multiple LLMs: We need a high quality LLM for generating itinerary ideas and writing up the final proposal.*
*     - Tools for LLMs to use. MCP tools (backed by Docker MCP gateway) for web search, Google maps and Airbnb; the Embabel platform built in math tool to allow distance and other calculations.* 
*   # The Hard Part: Making Tripper Reliable
*   *You could throw all these tools at a large state of the art LLM and let it decide how to call them, in what a skeptical NVIDIA paper calls language model agency.*
*   *Experience building Tripper showed that this would not produce acceptable results.*
*   *Gotchas included:*
*     - Invalid generated URLs. 
*     - Confusion around images.* 
*     - Inconsistent tool usage.*
*    - Poor choice of tool arguments.*

- Constructors may not contain any code except assignment statements.
- Implementation inheritance must be avoided at all costs (not to be confused with subtyping).
- Getters must be avoided, as they are symptoms of an anemic object model.
- The DDD paradigm must be respected.
- Elegant Objects design principles must be respected.
- Class names may not end with the -er suffix.

- Every class may encapsulate no more than four attributes.
- Every class must encapsulate at least one attribute.
- Utility classes are strictly prohibited.
- Static methods in classes are strictly prohibited.
- Method names must respect the CQRS principle: they must be either nouns or verbs.
- Classes must avoid using public static literals.
- Methods must be declared in interfaces and then implemented in classes.
- Public methods that do not implement an interface must be avoided.
- Methods must never return null.
- Methods should avoid checking incoming arguments for validity.
- null may not be passed as an argument.
- Type introspection and type casting are strictly prohibited.
- Reflection on object internals is strictly prohibited.
- All classes must be declared final, thus prohibiting inheritance.
- Exception messages must include as much context as possible.
- Every change must be covered by a unit test to guarantee repeatability.
- Every test case may contain only one assertion.
- In every test, the assertion must be the last statement.
- Test cases must be as short as possible.
- Every test must assert at least once.
- Each test file must have a one-to-one mapping with the feature file it tests.
- Every assertion must include a failure message that is a negatively toned claim about the error.
- Tests must use irregular inputs, such as non-ASCII strings.
- Tests may not share object attributes.
- Tests may not use setUp() or tearDown() idioms.
- Tests may not use static literals or other shared constants.
- Tests must be named as full English sentences, stating what the object under test does.
- Tests may not test functionality irrelevant to their stated purpose.
- Tests must close resources they use, such as file handlers, sockets, and database connections.
- Objects must not provide functionality used only by tests.
- Tests may not assert on side effects such as logging output.
- Tests may not check the behavior of setters, getters, or constructors.
- Tests must not clean up after themselves; instead, they must prepare a clean state at the start.
- Tests should not use mocks, favoring fake objects and stubs.
- The best tests consist of a single statement.
- Tests should use Hamcrest matchers if available.
- Each test must verify only one specific behavioral pattern of the object it tests.
- Tests must use random values as inputs.
- Tests should store temporary files in temporary directories, not in the codebase directory.
- Tests are not allowed to print any log messages.
- The testing framework must be configured to disable logging from the objects under test.
- Tests must not wait indefinitely for any event; they must always stop waiting on a timeout.
- Tests must verify object behavior in multi-threaded, concurrent environments.
- Tests must retry potentially flaky code blocks.
- Tests must assume the absence of an Internet connection.
- Tests may not assert on error messages or codes.
- Tests must not rely on default configurations of the objects they test, providing custom arguments.
- Tests must not mock the file system, sockets, or memory managers.
- Tests must use ephemeral TCP ports, generated using appropriate library functions.
- Tests should inline small fixtures instead of loading them from files.
- Tests should create large fixtures at runtime rather than store them in files.
- Tests may create supplementary fixture objects to avoid code duplication.
- Test method names must spell “cannot” and “dont” without apostrophes

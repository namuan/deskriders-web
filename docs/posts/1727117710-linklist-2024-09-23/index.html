<pre tabindex="0"><code>- Optopsy is an open source Python library for backtesting options trading strategies
- Created by Michael Chu and hosted on GitHub
- Uses a bucketing methodology to group option chains
- Groups option chains by days to expiration and delta/strike distance from current price
- Evaluates profit/loss of each option chain and aggregates results into buckets
- Generates statistics including average profit/loss, minimum, maximum, and distributions
- Focuses on answering core questions rather than fully replicating real-world events
- Results are meant for theoretical understanding, not actual trade recommendations
- Does not factor in external events or sequence of events over time
- Accuracy can be improved by refining bucket intervals
- Wiki covers methodology, API reference, data feeds, usage, and contributing
- Feedback and contributions are welcomed by the developer
- Allows programmatic backtesting of options strategies in Python
- Analyzes statistical outcomes across different implied market states
- Goal is insight into potential performance rather than replicating real events
- Available open source on GitHub for use, learning, and contribution

<pre tabindex="0"><code>- Project: thought-forge-ai
- Created by: phiresky
- Purpose: Generate 30-60 second &#34;deep thought&#34; TikTok-style videos
- Video components:
    - Spoken monologue
    - Moving video scenes
    - Background music
    - Subtitles

- Key features:
    - Fully automated content creation
    - Uses various AI tools and custom code
    - Generates philosophical and self-improvement content

- Process steps:
    1. Choose topics, voice, and clickbait title
    2. Write monologue script
    3. Convert text to speech
    4. Split monologue into scenes and create image prompts
    5. Generate starting images for each scene
    6. Create scene videos
    7. Generate music prompt and create music
    8. Create subtitles
    9. Merge and finalize video

- Tools used:
    - LLM (Claude 3.5 or Llama 3.1)
    - Text-to-Speech (Elevenlabs or coqui-ai)
    - Text-to-Image (Flux.1 Pro)
    - Image-to-Video (RunwayML Gen-3 Alpha)
    - Text-to-Audio for music (MusicGen)
    - FFmpeg for video processing

- Setup:
    - Uses pnpm for dependency management
    - Requires multiple API keys for various services
    - Provides commands for generating topics and videos

- Current state:
    - Quality varies from mediocre to surprisingly good
    - Potential for improvement with better prompts or human input
    - Video generation is the most expensive and challenging part

- License: Included but not specified in the summary
- Language: 100% TypeScript

<pre tabindex="0"><code>- Introduces Contextual Retrieval, an improved method for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Contextual Retrieval uses two sub-techniques: Contextual Embeddings and Contextual BM25
- Can reduce failed retrievals by 49%, and by 67% when combined with reranking
- Addresses the context loss problem in traditional RAG systems
- Works by prepending chunk-specific explanatory context to each chunk before embedding and indexing
- Uses Claude to generate concise, chunk-specific context for each piece of information
- Leverages Anthropic&#39;s prompt caching feature to reduce costs
- Experimented across various knowledge domains, embedding models, and retrieval strategies
- Contextual Embeddings reduced top-20-chunk retrieval failure rate by 35%
- Combining Contextual Embeddings and Contextual BM25 reduced failure rate by 49%
- Adding reranking further reduced failure rate to 67%
- Provides implementation considerations:
    - Chunk boundaries
    - Embedding model choice
    - Custom contextualizer prompts
    - Number of chunks
    - Importance of evaluations
- Reranking can further boost performance but adds latency and cost
- Best results achieved by combining contextual embeddings, contextual BM25, reranking, and using 20 chunks
- Cookbook available for developers to experiment with these approaches
- Tested various embedding models, with Voyage and Gemini performing best

<pre tabindex="0"><code>- The blog post discusses the benefits of using CloudFront + Lambda Function URL (CLFURL) over API Gateway for simple API deployments.
- CLFURL offers significant cost savings compared to API Gateway, especially when considering the cost of unauthorized requests.
- CLFURL provides a longer timeout (1 minute) compared to API Gateway&#39;s 29-second limit, making it suitable for AI-powered applications that require more processing time.
- While CloudFront introduces a slight latency for cross-region requests, it performs better than API Gateway under load.
- The blog post addresses security concerns by recommending using AWS_IAM authorization for LFURLs and implementing custom headers for authentication.
- It explores various solutions for locking down LFURLs to prevent unauthorized access, including using CloudFront Functions and Lambda@Edge.
- The blog post highlights the advantages of performing JWT validation within the Lambda Function instead of using API Gateway Authorizers.
- The author concludes that CLFURL is a cost-effective and performant alternative to API Gateway for simple API deployments, particularly for AI-powered applications.
- The blog post provides a repository with a code example for comparing CLFURL and API Gateway.
- Code Genie will soon offer CLFURL as an option for generating API code.

<pre tabindex="0"><code>- The blog post outlines the common components of a generative AI platform, including context enhancement, guardrails, model router and gateway, cache, complex logic, and write actions.
- It emphasizes the importance of observability and orchestration for monitoring, debugging, and managing the platform.
- The post discusses various techniques for enhancing context, including Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), text-to-SQL, and agentic RAGs.
- It covers different types of guardrails, including input guardrails (to prevent leaking private information and model jailbreaking) and output guardrails (to evaluate response quality and manage failures).
- The blog post explains the roles of model routers and gateways in managing multiple models and providing a unified interface for developers.
- It explores different caching techniques, including prompt cache, exact cache, and semantic cache, to optimize for latency and cost.
- The post discusses adding complex logic and write actions to enhance the capabilities of the platform, while addressing the associated risks and security concerns.
- It highlights the importance of observability through metrics, logs, and traces for monitoring and debugging the platform.
- The blog post covers AI pipeline orchestration, outlining the steps involved in defining and chaining components to create an end-to-end application flow.
- It provides a comprehensive overview of the architecture and considerations for building a generative AI platform.

  <meta name="twitter:description" content="https://elmwealth.com/microstrategy-bitcoin/ The text is a research report on MicroStrategy (MSTR), a company that has been focused on buying Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The authors of the report provide an analysis of various aspects of MSTR, including its stock price, options trading activity, and return characteristics.
Some key points from the report include:
MicroStrategy’s stock price: The report notes that MicroStrategy’s stock price has returned a significant 200% in about seven months, making it one of the best-performing stocks in the past year. Options trading activity: The authors highlight that hundreds of bullish options trades have been executed on MSTR, which suggests strong investor interest in the stock. Return characteristics: The report notes that the return pattern of MicroStrategy’s stock is not very enticing compared to other long-short ETFs, which would be a convenient way to take advantage of potential underperformance. Risk and frictions: The authors caution that MSTR trading comes with high risks and frictions, making it difficult to short or leveraged trade the stock effectively. Leveraged ETF analysis: They analyze a hypothetical long-short ETF that would be long 1x Bitcoin and short 1x MSTR, which they conclude would not be an attractive investment opportunity due to its relatively low return and high risks. Overall, the report suggests that while MicroStrategy’s stock price has been strong, investors should exercise caution when considering leveraged trading or shorting the stock due to the high risks involved.">

<p>This is a comprehensive guide to building effective AI agents. Here&rsquo;s a breakdown of the key principles and takeaways:</p>
<p><strong>Core Principles</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Separate Concerns</strong>: Break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable components, and assign each component to a specific module or function.</li>
<li><strong>Implement Feedback Loops</strong>: Continuously monitor and evaluate the agent&rsquo;s performance, and use feedback to improve its behavior.</li>
<li><strong>Maintain Strict Guardrails</strong>: Establish clear boundaries and rules for the agent&rsquo;s behavior, and ensure it adheres to them.</li>
<li><strong>Test Thoroughly</strong>: Conduct rigorous testing and validation to ensure the agent&rsquo;s reliability and accuracy.</li>
<li><strong>Start Small</strong>: Begin with a minimal set of capabilities and expand gradually as the agent is verified in production environments.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Additional Best Practices</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Use Existing Authentication and Authorization Mechanisms</strong>: Leverage existing security measures to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches.</li>
<li><strong>Sanitize Input</strong>: Use tools like llm-guard to prevent prompt injection and other types of attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Detect Manipulation Attempts</strong>: Implement mechanisms to detect and reject attempts to manipulate the agent or use it for malicious purposes.</li>
<li><strong>Monitor System Behavior</strong>: Continuously monitor the agent&rsquo;s behavior and adjust its configuration as needed.</li>
<li><strong>Gather User Feedback</strong>: Collect feedback from users to improve the agent&rsquo;s performance and accuracy.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Importance of Evaluations</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Evaluations are Critical</strong>: Regular evaluations are essential to ensure the agent is performing as expected and identify areas for improvement.</li>
<li><strong>Probabilistic Nature of LLMs</strong>: Due to the probabilistic nature of Large Language Models (LLMs), evaluations must be repeated multiple times to capture the agent&rsquo;s true behavior.</li>
<li><strong>Custom Evaluation Tools</strong>: Create custom evaluation tools to assess the agent&rsquo;s performance, such as comparing factuality and semantic similarity.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Security Considerations</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Authentication and Authorization</strong>: Ensure that the agent has only access to authorized data and systems.</li>
<li><strong>Sanitization</strong>: Protect against prompt injection and other types of attacks by sanitizing input.</li>
<li><strong>Detection of Manipulation Attempts</strong>: Implement mechanisms to detect and reject attempts to manipulate the agent or use it for malicious purposes.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Building effective AI agents requires careful attention to these core principles, best practices, and security considerations. By implementing feedback loops, separating concerns, and maintaining strict guardrails, we can create agents that are both powerful and reliable. Remember to test thoroughly and start small, and don&rsquo;t be afraid to expand an agent&rsquo;s capabilities over time as you verify its reliability in production environments.</p>

<pre tabindex="0"><code>* Students in an after-school program in Edo, Nigeria, participated in an AI-powered learning initiative, showing positive effects on learning outcomes.
* The program boosted learning across various areas, including English language, AI knowledge, and digital skills, with students who participated outperforming their peers.
* Benefits extended beyond the scope of the program, as students who learned to engage effectively with AI performed better on end-of-year exams covering topics outside the intervention&#39;s focus.
* Girls initially lagging behind boys in performance showed significant gains from the intervention, bridging gender gaps in learning.
* Deeper engagement with the AI program resulted in greater learning gains, with each additional day of attendance leading to improved outcomes.
* The learning improvements were striking, equivalent to nearly two years of typical learning in just six weeks.
* The program outperformed 80% of other education interventions studied through randomized controlled trials in developing contexts.
* Future research is needed to explore long-term effects, benefits beyond immediate gains, and the role of teachers in supporting interactions with large language models.

<pre tabindex="0"><code>* Using uv as an installer
* It’s hard to reliably package and distribute python command line tools to end users. Users frequently encounter challenges: dependency version conflicts, virtual environment management, needing to install python or a specific version of python, etc.
* Aider employs uv in a couple of novel ways to streamline the installation process:
    + Install aider with `curl https://aider.chat/install.sh | sh`
    + Users who have python 3.8+ installed can use `pip install aider-install &amp;&amp; aider-install`.
* Both methods use uv to globally install the aider command line program, with all of its dependencies in an isolated environment.
* They ensure that aider will run with python 3.12, and install that version if it is not already available.
* These uv install methods are especially helpful for aider, because it has a large set of very specific dependencies. Since not all of aider’s dependencies are available on all python versions, it requires python 3.9-3.12.
* Most users don’t want to worry about these details – they just want a quick way to install and run aider.
* One-liners
    + Users can install aider with a shell one-liner, without even having python previously installed: `curl -LsSf https://aider.chat/install.sh | sh`
* This installs uv, then uses it to install python 3.12, install the aider command line tool and update the user’s shell path.
* Under the hood, it is simply a copy of uv’s own install script with one line added, to install aider as a tool:
    + `ensure &#34;${_install_dir}/uv&#34; tool install --force --python python3.12 aider-chat@latest`
* aider-install python package allows quick global installation of aider for users who already have python 3.8+ installed.
* It simply provides the aider-install command line program, which users just need to run once.
    + `pip install aider-install`
* This installs only two packages: aider-install and the uv python package.
* This ensures that uv is available in the user’s environment.
* Everything else is installed in a stand-alone environment created by uv.
* When the user runs aider-install, it runs uv to install aider as a tool and update the user’s shell path if needed:
    + `uv tool install --force --python python3.12 aider-chat`
    + `uv tool update-shell`
* Benefits
* These uv install methods have been popular with users, providing a hassle free way to install aider and quickly get started.
* Installs are also extremely fast, much faster than pip or pipx installs even when uv is also installing python 3.12!
* There are also a number of benefits from the perspective of the tool developer/publisher.
* Since providing these install methods, far fewer users report dependency problems and version conflicts as compared to users who pip install aider-chat.
* There is also less pressure to rapidly support the newest python versions, since aider always installs with python 3.12.

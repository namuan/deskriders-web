      <description>In this short clip, we&#39;ll look at &amp;lsquo;lsof&amp;rsquo;, a simple tool on MacOS to list all open ports and get their process identifiers.
Requirements:   📝:
👉 Tested on MacOS Mojave but should work on earlier versions and all flavours of Linux 👉 ManPage: https://linux.die.net/man/8/lsof 👉 Reference to other commands: https://www.howtoforge.com/linux-lsof-command/</description>

      <description>This is hopefully first of many (tool)tips where I create a very short ( ~ 30sec -&amp;gt; 1min) video 📹covering a specific task.
In this first video, we&#39;ll look at creating a command line launcher for IntelliJ. Although this is created using IntelliJ IDEA but the same option should be available in WebStorm, PhpStorm, PyCharm etc.

      <description>Here is a simple setup explaining a comment I made on Reddit.
All I have is a notes.txt under my home directory where the snippets (one-liners) are stored in the following format. Note that I don&#39;t store block of code or longer text here as they&#39;ll become difficult to search.
find . -type f -name &amp;#39;*.txt&amp;#39; -exec sed -i &amp;#39;&amp;#39; s/this/that/g {} + # search and replace sed find It starts with the command then # and a brief comment on what it does.</description>

      <title>Introducing DevRider :: One Desktop App for Common Development Tools</title>
      <link>/posts/010-introducing-devrider/</link>

      <description>There is a serious problem with the state of simple development tools on the internet.
Most of the websites providing simple encoders/decoders/formatters/prettifiers are filled with ads and popups which makes it annoying and risky to use.
And then there is also a huge problem with privacy and leaking any private data that is used on any of these websites.
Although it is impossible to replace them altogether, let me introduce you to DevRider, a new open source to provide some of the common tools in an extensible desktop application.</description>

      <description>Please check the previous part to know the background of this project.
In this part, we&#39;ll dive into code and deploy a simple API to AWS Lambda and Api Gateway.
I&#39;ll be using Python Flask framework for defining the APIs and Serverless framework to manage the infrastructure and deployment.
Please make sure you have Python3 and relatively newer version of nodejs installed and working to follow along.
The first step is to create a new project folder and initialise package.</description>

      <description>This is a short post on how to add a floating button on top of a widget in PyQt5.
First, we&#39;ll define the button and the relative positioning.
class FloatingButtonWidget(QtWidgets.QPushButton): #1 def __init__(self, parent): super().__init__(parent) self.paddingLeft = 5 self.paddingTop = 5 def update_position(self): if hasattr(self.parent(), &amp;#39;viewport&amp;#39;): parent_rect = self.parent().viewport().rect() else: parent_rect = self.parent().rect() if not parent_rect: return x = parent_rect.width() - self.width() - self.paddingLeft y = self.paddingTop #3 self.setGeometry(x, y, self.</description>

      <description>In this series of articles, I&#39;ll go through my experience of building a simple Serverless API using Flask python framework and deploying it on AWS Lambda and API gateway.
This API is used from HttpRider to save API exchanges (request+response).
Here is a sample page generated from HttpRider.
Demo The service itself consists of two simple APIs.
POST /prints Saves the HTML encoded in base64 in dynamo database. Once it is saved, it returns the URL of the shared document in the Location header of the response.</description>

      <guid>/posts/005-protecting-applications-oauth2-proxy/</guid>
      <description>Here is a simple guide on protecting a website with social logins supporting OAuth2. It uses an open source OAuth2 Proxy (which is a fork from Bitly OAuth2 Proxy) to secure private applications without adding any authentication logic in the application itself.
Here, we&#39;ll see how to secure the open source version of https://httpbin.org. Httpbin application itself is open and can be accessed without any authentication.
In this guide, we will setup a Github OAuth application but the same setup can be easily configured with any other provider.</description>

      <description>The title is a bit misleading as HttpRider can&#39;t run performance tests (as of now), however it can be used to generate performance tests using a couple of different approach.
Slow cooker: SlowCooker is a command line tool for load testing. Here is an excellent blog post about the background and difference from other similar tools.
Generating code to run slow cooker is as simple as selecting an API call and click on the export button to generate code.</description>

      <guid>/posts/003-httprider-generating-bdd-tests/</guid>
      <description>In this post, we&#39;ll see how we can easily generate BDD tests with HttpRider.
Instead of writing the code behind the REST api calls, we&#39;ll use an open source framework called Apickli to do the heavy lifting. Apickli is based on cucumber.js and defines a number of pre-built Gherkin expressions.
I&#39;ve also created a sample project using Apicki framework to make it easy to get it up and running.
Let&#39;s start with a few API calls using the sample database provided with source.</description>

      <description>Runscope (Now Part of BlazeMeter) is a well known service for API Monitoring. This post covers generating Runscope monitoring tests from HttpRider.
We start with API definitions in HttpRider, make sure you run them at least once as some of the exporters use the data from the response.
Along with API definitions, it also generates Runscope environments with placeholders for any variables used from environment.
Once the tests have successfully finished, click on the export/export all button to display the code generator.</description>

      <guid>/posts/001-httprider-generating-sequence-diagrams/</guid>
      <description>Most tools consider an HTTP API call as a single request but that is not usually the case. An API call is surrounded by a sequence of other APIs which makes it easy to understand the context of the use case.
In HttpRider, I&#39;ve recently introduced an exporter for sequence diagrams. So a collection of HTTP calls can be easily exported to sequence diagrams using PlantUML/MermaidJS.
 HttpRider is an open source cross platform desktop client for working with JSON APIs</description>

      <description>In this post, I&#39;ll go through what is involved in building a MacOS release package and publishing it on Github from TravisCI.
Step 1: Application Icon Although it is probably quicker to find/generate a logo from an online service. I decided to create a simple logo to go through the process of creating and converting it in vector drawing.
Here is what I ended up using the Paper app on iPad.</description>

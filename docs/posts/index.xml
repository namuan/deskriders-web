      <description>Prompt used for generating summary of each page in Poe As instructed before, Summarise it using only bullet points in markdown syntax. No headings, just bullet points. I want it as raw markdown so that I can use it in README.md file {clipboard} https://github.com/michaelchu/optopsy/wiki - Optopsy is an open source Python library for backtesting options trading strategies - Created by Michael Chu and hosted on GitHub - Uses a bucketing methodology to group option chains - Groups option chains by days to expiration and delta/strike distance from current price - Evaluates profit/loss of each option chain and aggregates results into buckets - Generates statistics including average profit/loss, minimum, maximum, and distributions - Focuses on answering core questions rather than fully replicating real-world events - Results are meant for theoretical understanding, not actual trade recommendations - Does not factor in external events or sequence of events over time - Accuracy can be improved by refining bucket intervals - Wiki covers methodology, API reference, data feeds, usage, and contributing - Feedback and contributions are welcomed by the developer - Allows programmatic backtesting of options strategies in Python - Analyzes statistical outcomes across different implied market states - Goal is insight into potential performance rather than replicating real events - Available open source on GitHub for use, learning, and contribution https://compute.</description>

This is how the straddles look before market open, so I think I need to adjust at least one which is expiring on the 6th.
XSP Sep 6th 562 Short Straddle
The price is almost touching the put strike. We have already done one adjustment here, so there are a couple of potential further adjustments:</description>

      <description>I selected IYR (as Real Estate proxy) and SPY and compare them over the last 24 years. This is expected but surprising to see the performance from 2001 - to date.
As seen in the bottom chart, the stock market just managed to rise above the Real Estate returns.
SPY (571%) vs IYR (549%)
But the picture changes if we start a little later. Here is the comparison every 4 years from 2001.</description>

      <description>This can go in the application.properties file.
# Single line. Full stack trace will be captured in a single line logging.exception-conversion-word=%replace(%wEx){&amp;#39;\n&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;\u2028&amp;#39;}%nopex # Truncated Single line. Only the exception message will be captured in a single line logging.exception-conversion-word=%replace(%wEx{short}){&amp;#39;\n&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;\u2028&amp;#39;}%nopex # Truncated. Default formatting but only capturing a single line logging.exception-conversion-word=%wEx{short} This works if you don&amp;rsquo;t override logging.pattern.console as the default logging.pattern.console allows you to use logging.exception-converstion-word
If you need to only filter out certain packages from exception stack trace.</description>

      <description>Here is a simple way to keep README document in-sync if you have a number of things to document.
And it looks like this:
Each script needs to response to --help when called which is then collected and rendered into README.md between a set of pre-configured tokens.
readme_docs.py contains the code to generate this documentation.
It is also configured as a pre-commit hook so that we always keep it up to date.</description>

      <description>An ongoing thought process on how to help with generating code when working on a microservices based architecture.
In most organisations I worked with, the usual microservices development model is roughly divided into two main parts.
1. Common Functionality We can classify the following responsibilities as common across multiple micro services
Build and deployment pipeline Logging destination and output Environment Configuration Publishing metrics Tracing across multiple services API request/response formats Handling Idempotency where applicable All of these will feed into different architectural concerns where it is important to have consistency across multiple microservices.</description>

      <description>Wiremock is a tool to mock HTTP APIs. You can set up Stubs in Wiremock by using their API or by calling the admin API over HTTP. Usually it is used as part of a test suite but here I&amp;rsquo;m running the standalone Wiremock server.
Once the jar file is downloaded, you can start the server by running the following command:
java -jar wiremock-jre8-standalone-2.32.0.jar Here we are setting multiple URLs to match in a single mapping.</description>

Step 1: Add gradle/maven dependency https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.jeasy/easy-random
Step 2: Declare it in test Step 3: Use it to generate random data objects Step 4: 😍 Tips: Random initial seed In the default setup, EasyRandom uses a default seed value to generate randam data. Although it is quite simple to initiate EasyRandom with a random seed.</description>

Here, I&amp;rsquo;ll add a test which is ignored when running ./gradlew test but it can be triggered when needed (eg. from a separate Jenkins Job).
The current directory structure look this
The first step is to exclude all the tests under contracts/
test { ... exclude(&amp;#39;**/contracts/*.*&amp;#39;) } Then we&amp;rsquo;ll define another Gradle task so that contract tests can be executed on demand</description>

find . -type f -name &amp;#39;*.txt&amp;#39; -exec sed -i &amp;#39;&amp;#39; s/this/that/g {} + # search and replace sed find It starts with the command then # and a brief comment on what it does.</description>

      <title>Introducing DevRider :: One Desktop App for Common Development Tools</title>

      <description>There is a serious problem with the state of simple development tools on the internet.
Most of the websites providing simple encoders/decoders/formatters/prettifiers are filled with ads and popups which makes it annoying and risky to use.
And then there is also a huge problem with privacy and leaking any private data that is used on any of these websites.
Although it is impossible to replace them altogether, let me introduce you to DevRider, a new open source to provide some of the common tools in an extensible desktop application.</description>

      <description>Please check the previous part to know the background of this project.
In this part, we&amp;rsquo;ll dive into code and deploy a simple API to AWS Lambda and Api Gateway.
I&amp;rsquo;ll be using Python Flask framework for defining the APIs and Serverless framework to manage the infrastructure and deployment.
Please make sure you have Python3 and relatively newer version of nodejs installed and working to follow along.
The first step is to create a new project folder and initialise package.</description>

      <description>This is a short post on how to add a floating button on top of a widget in PyQt5.
First, we&amp;rsquo;ll define the button and the relative positioning.
class FloatingButtonWidget(QtWidgets.QPushButton): #1 def __init__(self, parent): super().__init__(parent) self.paddingLeft = 5 self.paddingTop = 5 def update_position(self): if hasattr(self.parent(), &amp;#39;viewport&amp;#39;): parent_rect = self.parent().viewport().rect() else: parent_rect = self.parent().rect() if not parent_rect: return x = parent_rect.width() - self.width() - self.paddingLeft y = self.paddingTop #3 self.setGeometry(x, y, self.</description>

      <description>In this series of articles, I&amp;rsquo;ll go through my experience of building a simple Serverless API using Flask python framework and deploying it on AWS Lambda and API gateway.
This API is used from HttpRider to save API exchanges (request+response).
Here is a sample page generated from HttpRider.
Demo The service itself consists of two simple APIs.
POST /prints Saves the HTML encoded in base64 in dynamo database. Once it is saved, it returns the URL of the shared document in the Location header of the response.</description>

      <guid>/posts/005-protecting-applications-oauth2-proxy/</guid>
      <description>Here is a simple guide on protecting a website with social logins supporting OAuth2. It uses an open source OAuth2 Proxy (which is a fork from Bitly OAuth2 Proxy) to secure private applications without adding any authentication logic in the application itself.
Here, we&amp;rsquo;ll see how to secure the open source version of https://httpbin.org. Httpbin application itself is open and can be accessed without any authentication.
In this guide, we will setup a Github OAuth application but the same setup can be easily configured with any other provider.</description>

      <description>The title is a bit misleading as HttpRider can&amp;rsquo;t run performance tests (as of now), however it can be used to generate performance tests using a couple of different approach.
Slow cooker: SlowCooker is a command line tool for load testing. Here is an excellent blog post about the background and difference from other similar tools.
Generating code to run slow cooker is as simple as selecting an API call and click on the export button to generate code.</description>

      <title>Generating BDD tests with HttpRider</title>

      <description>In this post, we&amp;rsquo;ll see how we can easily generate BDD tests with HttpRider.
Instead of writing the code behind the REST api calls, we&amp;rsquo;ll use an open source framework called Apickli to do the heavy lifting. Apickli is based on cucumber.js and defines a number of pre-built Gherkin expressions.
I&amp;rsquo;ve also created a sample project using Apicki framework to make it easy to get it up and running.
Let&amp;rsquo;s start with a few API calls using the sample database provided with source.</description>

      <description>Runscope (Now Part of BlazeMeter) is a well known service for API Monitoring. This post covers generating Runscope monitoring tests from HttpRider.
We start with API definitions in HttpRider, make sure you run them at least once as some of the exporters use the data from the response.
Along with API definitions, it also generates Runscope environments with placeholders for any variables used from environment.
Once the tests have successfully finished, click on the export/export all button to display the code generator.</description>

      <title>Generating sequence diagrams with HttpRider</title>

      <guid>/posts/001-httprider-generating-sequence-diagrams/</guid>
      <description>Most tools consider an HTTP API call as a single request but that is not usually the case. An API call is surrounded by a sequence of other APIs which makes it easy to understand the context of the use case.
In HttpRider, I&amp;rsquo;ve recently introduced an exporter for sequence diagrams. So a collection of HTTP calls can be easily exported to sequence diagrams using PlantUML/MermaidJS.
HttpRider is an open source cross platform desktop client for working with JSON APIs</description>

      <description>In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll go through what is involved in building a MacOS release package and publishing it on Github from TravisCI.
Step 1: Application Icon Although it is probably quicker to find/generate a logo from an online service. I decided to create a simple logo to go through the process of creating and converting it in vector drawing.
Here is what I ended up using the Paper app on iPad.</description>

This is how the market looked yesterday (2024-09-03):

And this is how it looks today:

This is after a 2.12% drop.

This is how the straddles look before market open, so I think I need to adjust at least one which is expiring on the 6th.

**XSP Sep 6th 562 Short Straddle**

The price is almost touching the put strike. We have already done one adjustment here, so there are a couple of potential further adjustments:

Or we can close this trade for a loss of around 50% of initial credit - realized gain of selling previous call for a profit.

**XSP Sep 9th 558 Short Straddle**

This one looks fine for now, so I will keep an eye on it if the market keeps going down.

**XSP Sep 10th 556 Short Straddle**

This one is also looking fine for now.

I selected IYR (as Real Estate proxy) and SPY and compare them over the last 24 years. 
This is expected but surprising to see the performance from 2001 - to date.

As seen in the bottom chart, the stock market just managed to rise above the Real Estate returns.

**SPY (571%) vs IYR (549%)**

But the picture changes if we start a little later.
Here is the comparison every 4 years from 2001.

### From 2005 - to date

**SPY (574%) vs IYR (230%)**

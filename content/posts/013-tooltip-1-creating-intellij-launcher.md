This is hopefully first of many (tool)tips where I create a very short ( ~ 30sec -> 1min) video ðŸ“¹covering a specific task.

In this first video, we'll look at creating a command line launcher for IntelliJ. 
Although this is created using IntelliJ IDEA but the same option should be available in WebStorm, PhpStorm, PyCharm etc.

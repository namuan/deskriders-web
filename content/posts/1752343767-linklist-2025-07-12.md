## https://samwho.dev/reservoir-sampling/

```
- Reservoir sampling is a technique for selecting a fair random sample when you don't know the size of the set you're sampling from.
- It's used when you can only hold one item at a time and want every item to have an equal chance of being selected.
- The problem is that when you show n items, 1/n is the chance of each new item being chosen and then it also becomes 1/(n-1) for each previous item that gets replaced, but we only care about the probability of a new card being chosen.
- When k cards are chosen from n, there's a formula where 1/n is the chance of each new card being selected and k/(n-1) is the chance of any held card getting replaced, both probabilities staying equal.
- Reservoir sampling works by generating an array of size k for holding cards. For each new item, it generates a random number between 0 and n. If that's less than k, replace the card at that index with the new one; otherwise discard the new one.
- The reservoir sampling algorithm can be used in various scenarios like log collection where you want to receive at most k logs per second but never more.
- A weighted variant of reservoir sampling exists for cases where some items are more valuable than others.

## https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2025/05/why-does-the-u-s-always-run-a-trade-deficit/

```
* The United States' trade deficit is primarily driven by a persistent shortfall in domestic saving that requires foreign funding to finance domestic investment spending.
* In a closed economy, spending equals income, and therefore investment spending equals domestic saving.
* When an economy opens up to external borrowing or lending, domestic saving and investment spending can diverge.
* The saving gap framework shows that the difference between domestic saving and investment spending is equivalent to the trade deficit in terms of its overall magnitude.
* The trade deficit reflects a macroeconomic phenomenon, rather than just differences in exports and imports.
* Imports and exports are equal when revenue from exports matches spending on imports; otherwise, foreign funds buy domestic assets instead of U.S. exports.
* The trade deficit is not tied to specific items, but rather a result of the saving gap between domestic and investment spending.
* Reducing the trade deficit requires both more exports relative to imports and a narrowing of the gap between saving and investment spending.
* Focusing solely on imports and exports can be misleading, as policy changes may affect the size and composition of cross-border trade without necessarily reducing the overall deficit.
* The goal of achieving a smaller trade deficit may require painful recalibration of domestic savings and investment.
* Research has shown that episodes of substantial reductions in trade deficits are often facilitated by lower investment spending followed by higher saving.

```
+ We compared the quality and pricing of historical intraday data from TradeStation, Polygon.io, and Alpaca for US stocks/ETFs.
+ All three providers offer 1-minute bar data, but with different pricing models: free or low-cost options (Alpaca, TradeStation) vs. a subscription-based service (Polygon.io).
+ Key findings:
  - Near-perfect price correlation among all three providers for 1-minute data (1.0).
  - Significant volume discrepancies between TradeStation and Polygon.io/Alpaca.
  - Small but notable differences in specific price points.
* # Conclusion
+ Alpaca emerges as the standout winner for algorithmic traders seeking reliable and affordable historical intraday data due to its exceptional value proposition, including free access to 10 years of high-quality data.

## https://mkosir.github.io/typescript-style-guide/

```
This is a style guide for React development, covering various aspects of coding conventions, testing, and best practices. Here are the main sections:

**Components**

* Use functions as the default component type (`React.FC`).
* Prefer container components with postfix "Container" or "Page".
* Feature components should be representedational, nested inside container components.
* Design system components (e.g., Button) should be reusable and global.

**Props**

* Avoid using props to state. If necessary, prefix the prop with `initial`.
* Use props argument with type instead of `React.FC` type.
* Pass only necessary props to child components.
* Utilize storing state in the URL for filtering, sorting, etc.

**Testing**

* Implement tests that are short, explicit, and pleasant to work with.
* Strive for AAA pattern (Arrange-Act-Assert) in unit tests.
* Keep functions pure and impure small and focused.
* Write tests as isolated as possible and resilient to changes.
* Black box testing is encouraged, testing implementation details is not.

**Best Practices**

* Avoid using React.FC type directly; instead, use the function type with props argument.
* Consider refactoring render method, local states in parent components, and using composition when prop drilling becomes an issue.
* Use server-state library for data fetching (e.g., react-query) and client-state library for global state is discouraged.

**Code Style**

* Follow the naming convention "it('should ... when ...')" for test descriptions.
* Avoid snapshot tests unless there's a strong rationale behind them.
* Keep the codebase stable by avoiding unnecessary changes to tests.

Overall, this style guide emphasizes best practices, conventions, and testing principles for React development.

## https://addyo.substack.com/p/the-prompt-engineering-playbook-for

```
This article provides an in-depth guide on prompt engineering, a crucial skill for developers working with AI code assistants. The author covers various aspects of effective prompting, including:

1. Crafting clear and context-rich prompts: Providing the necessary information about the code, problem, or feature being asked to solve.
2. Iterating with the AI: Refining solutions through multiple prompts, refining assumptions, and breaking down complex requests into smaller, manageable pieces.
3. Role-playing and personas: Treating the AI as a code reviewer, mentor, or expert in a specific stack to elicit more rigorous and explanation-rich outputs.
4. Refactoring and optimization: Defining what "good" looks like (e.g., faster, cleaner, more idiomatic) and leveraging the AI's knowledge of best practices to improve code quality.
5. Pitfalls to avoid: Keeping prompts neither too vague nor too overloaded, specifying intent and constraints, and being prepared to adjust when the AI's output is off-target.

The author also highlights the importance of patience, iteration, and iterative dialogue in prompting, emphasizing that it's essential to approach prompting with the same clarity, patience, and thoroughness as communicating with another engineer.

Key takeaways from this article include:

* Prompt engineering empowers developers to get more out of AI assistants.
* It's a skill that requires practice, patience, and iteration.
* Effective prompting involves providing context-rich information, refining assumptions, and breaking down complex requests into smaller pieces.
* The author provides practical tips and strategies for refining prompts, including using role-playing and personas, defining what "good" looks like, and avoiding common pitfalls.

### Existing Positions

**/ESU24 Sep 16th 7DTE Short Straddle**

Closed it for a scratch which was pretty good as the market moved around 5% in a week.

Closed for -$12.50 (-0.2%) return since Sep 9, 2024 at 5:51 PM

**/ESU24 Sep 20th 7DTE Short Straddle**

Close one straddle to reduce margin requirement and bring strike back to the middle of straddle.
Looking to close this tomorrow before the FOMC announcement.

### New Position

## Experiments

Some trades that I'm following to learn and try out other strategies.

**/ESU24 Sep 16th 2DTE Short Straddle**

Closed for **+$657.25** return since Sep 12, 2024, 4:10 PM

**/ESU24 Sep 16th 0DTE Short Straddle (exp)**

Closed for **+$582.50** return since Sep 16, 2024, 3:04 PM

**/ESU24 Sep 18th 2DTE Short Straddle (exp)**

Almost 5% profit on the 2DTE so should close it

**/ESZ24 Sep 24th 7DTE Short Straddle (Exp)**

7DTE to watch due to FOMC announcement on the 18th. Paper trade due to extra uncertainty in the market.

```markdown
- The real deadline isn’t when AI outsmarts us — it’s when we stop using our own minds.
- "Time under tension" in fitness (e.g., slower squats) builds more muscle; thinking benefits from a similar principle.
- Deep thinking requires sitting with disconnected ideas to combine them into something new.
- AI executives claim humans have 18 months before AI surpasses us in the workforce.
- The bigger concern isn’t AI taking jobs but humans degrading their own thinking abilities.
- AI is already affecting deep thinking, writing, and reading skills.
- Students increasingly use AI to cheat, leading to a decline in writing and critical thinking.
- Writing is thinking; outsourcing it to AI empties the mind of original thought.
- Reading scores are at a 32-year low, with many students unable to focus on long texts.
- Even elite college students struggle with reading full books or sustained focus.
- High schools have "chunkified" books to prepare for standardized tests, reducing deep reading.
- Writing and reading are essential for deep symbolic thinking, a key skill in the modern economy.
- AI is the latest threat to deep thinking, following TV, the internet, and smartphones.
- Literacy restructures human thought, enabling complex ideas; its decline unwires cognitive abilities.
- The skill to prioritize in the AI age: patience for long texts, holding conflicting ideas, and engaging deeply with writing.
- The author prepares their child for resilience and adaptability, emphasizing continuous learning.
- The author (who has ADD) uses AI as a tool to refine their own writing, not replace it.
- AI can be helpful if used to clarify thoughts, not to bypass thinking entirely.

## https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1obn0q7/the_innovations_in_deepseek_ocr/

```markdown
- DeepSeek released a new paper called "DeepSeek OCR," which is more significant than a typical OCR model.
- Traditional vision LLM tokens were inefficient, often requiring more space than text tokens (e.g., 10k words → 15k tokens or 30k-60k visual tokens).
- DeepSeek achieved 10x better compression with vision tokens compared to text tokens (10k words → 1,500 compressed visual tokens).
- This aligns with human memory, where visual recall (e.g., book page layout) is often more efficient than textual recall.
- Unclear how this affects LLM reasoning—whether compressed visual tokens impact articulation or cognitive performance.
- Potential to expand context sizes significantly, especially when combined with sparse attention techniques.
- Google (Gemini) may already use similar methods, explaining its large context size and OCR efficiency, but keeps it secret.
- DeepSeek open-sourced their model, allowing public exploration and experimentation.
- Even with potential trade-offs (e.g., lossy attention), this could enable frontier LLMs with 10-20 million token context windows.
- Practical applications:
  - Storing entire company documents in a prompt preamble for efficient querying.
  - Caching entire codebases and updating them via git diffs.
- Analogy to physicist Hans Bethe, who memorized vast data for seamless problem-solving.
- This approach could expand working memory capacity by 10x or more.

## https://magazine.sebastianraschka.com/p/from-gpt-2-to-gpt-oss-analyzing-the

```markdown
- OpenAI released gpt-oss-120b and gpt-oss-20b, their first open-weight models since GPT-2 in 2019.
- These models can run locally with optimizations like MXFP4 quantization.
- The architecture builds on the transformer design but includes several modern tweaks.
- Key changes from GPT-2:
  - Removal of dropout (no longer needed due to single-epoch training).
  - Replacement of absolute positional embeddings with RoPE (Rotary Position Embedding).
  - Swish/SwiGLU activation functions replace GELU for computational efficiency.
  - Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) replaces single feed-forward modules for sparse activation.
  - Grouped Query Attention (GQA) replaces Multi-Head Attention (MHA) for efficiency.
  - Sliding window attention alternates with full-context layers to reduce compute costs.
  - RMSNorm replaces LayerNorm for cheaper normalization.
- Comparison with Qwen3:
  - gpt-oss is wider (larger embedding dimensions) while Qwen3 is deeper (more transformer blocks).
  - gpt-oss uses fewer, larger experts (32 vs. 128 in Qwen3) but activates fewer per token (4 vs. 8).
  - Both use GQA, but gpt-oss adds sliding window attention.
  - gpt-oss includes attention bias units (rare in modern models) and attention sinks (learned per-head bias logits).
- Training details:
  - Trained on mostly English, text-only datasets with a focus on STEM, coding, and general knowledge.
  - Includes supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning stages.
  - 2.1 million H100-hours for gpt-oss-120b (10x less for gpt-oss-20b).
- Reasoning capabilities:
  - Supports adjustable reasoning effort (low/medium/high) via system prompts.
  - Designed for tool use, potentially reducing reliance on memorization.
- MXFP4 optimization:
  - Enables single-GPU inference (80GB H100 for 120B model, 16GB VRAM for 20B model).
  - Requires RTX 50-series or newer for full efficiency (older GPUs supported with higher memory usage).
- Benchmarks:
  - Competitive with proprietary models like GPT-5 and Qwen3 in reasoning tasks.
  - Not yet listed on LM Arena leaderboard; early users report high hallucination rates.
- Licensing:
  - Apache 2.0 license (open-weight, not full open-source).
  - Allows commercial use and distillation into other models.
- GPT-5 context:
  - Released shortly after gpt-oss, showing OpenAI’s open models are close to proprietary performance.
- Additional notes:
  - Attention sinks stabilize long-context scenarios without modifying input tokens.
  - Sliding window attention (128 tokens) is smaller than in other models (e.g., Gemma’s 1024 tokens).
  - No base models released (only instruction-tuned versions), unlike Qwen3.

## https://eugeneyan.com/writing/principal/

```markdown
- Different principals have different strengths: deep expertise, horizontal influence, technical leadership, or cross-org alignment.
- Principals should remain hands-on, but their core role shifts to vision, design, sponsorship, and enabling others.
- Principals act as part-time PMs, engineers, designers, and more—nothing is outside their scope.
- More communication, influence, and cross-team collaboration are required; avoid shipping org charts to customers.
- Being right isn’t enough—you must convince others to act, build momentum, and secure sponsorship.
- Principals often teach the org to value new ideas, even if success rates are low (e.g., 3 out of 10 pitches).
- Focus on work that won’t happen without you—prototype, align orgs, or define long-term vision.
- Connecting teams, reusing solutions, and identifying growth opportunities can be more valuable than doing the work yourself.
- Scale impact by coaching and mentoring others; set aside time for office hours or regular syncs.
- Transition ownership to others—let them drive direction, even if their approach differs from yours.
- Create space in meetings for others to contribute; avoid dominating discussions.
- Silence in meetings can signal trust—if the team is on track, step back.
- In exec meetings, focus on meaningful questions and decisions only they can make.
- Guard your time—avoid becoming the "go-to" person for every meeting or review.
- If you can’t justify why a project needs a principal, reconsider its priority.
- Leverage organizational privilege to improve outcomes with minimal effort.
- Be mindful of your influence—casual comments may be overinterpreted.
- Always explain the "why" behind your decisions to prevent blind adherence.
- Stay connected with teams through reviews, demos, or informal interactions.
- Help teams see the bigger picture beyond day-to-day delivery.
- Balance big-picture thinking with pragmatic, local solutions.
- Decline low-quality feedback requests if you lack sufficient context.
- Engage with interns—early check-ins and meaningful projects can be transformative.
- Remove yourself from the critical path; empower others to take ownership.
- If promoted, continue what made you successful—engage with peers and define your focus.
- Autonomy comes with responsibility—choose high-leverage problems, not just what you prefer.
- Define your charter: owner (deep involvement), sponsor (alignment/drive), or consultant (guidance).
- Build a peer network—being a principal can feel isolating.
- Prioritize personal growth and well-being to avoid burnout.
- Keep learning—timebox stagnant projects and seek external knowledge (papers, prototypes).

## https://brooker.co.za/blog/2025/11/20/what-now.html

```markdown
- Cloudflare’s November 18 outage postmortem sparked discussions about error handling, focusing on Rust’s `Result` and `unwrap`.
- `Result` in Rust can hold a success or error; `unwrap` extracts the success or crashes the program (similar to `assert`).
- Debate on `assert` in production misses the point—error handling is a global system property, not local.
- Error handling game: Decide if crashing (✅) or not (❌) is appropriate, with justifications provided.
- Three principles guide error handling decisions:
  - **Correlated failures**: If failures are uncorrelated, crashing simplifies the system; if correlated, design to reject errors and continue.
  - **Higher-layer handling**: Traditional architectures handle low error rates; fine-grained (e.g., serverless) handle higher rates, making crashing more acceptable.
  - **Meaningful continuation**: Some systems (e.g., databases) must crash to avoid state corruption; others can use last-known-good versions.
- Error handling must be designed globally from the start; local decisions are insufficient.
- Blast radius reduction (e.g., cell-based architectures, shuffle sharding) limits damage from errors.
- `panic` (like `unwrap`) is treated as a crash here; Rust’s explicitness is better than C’s silent failures.
- Suggestions: Rename `unwrap` to `or_panic` or enforce justifications via lints (e.g., `clippy`).

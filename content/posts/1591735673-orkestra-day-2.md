Add a couple of things since last time.

- [X] Create a "Default" folder and populate on start up
- [X] Add a toolbar button menu to add different step type

As part of updating folders, I refactored a bunch of things. 
There is now an AppWorld which kinda holds a number of things. 
It provides access to data stores and other infrastructure components.

Here is a how folders update when the application starts.

**pytest-qt** 

Another useful thing I found is [pytest-qt](https://pytest-qt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html) which is an extension to pytest to drive and test desktop applications written in PyQt.
Once installed via pip, the following test checks if folders are updated

```python
from app.views.main_window import MainWindow


def test_show_all_folders(qtbot):
    # given
    window = MainWindow()

    # when
    window.show()
    qtbot.addWidget(window)

    # then
    assert window.cmb_folders.count() == 1
```

And another test to make sure that any text in scratchpad will be persisted during application restart.

```python
from app.views.main_window import MainWindow

def test_save_scratchpad(qtbot):
    # given
    window = MainWindow()
    window.show()
    qtbot.addWidget(window)

    # when
    window.txt_scratch_pad.setText("Hello World")
    window.close()

    # then
    window.show()

    # then
    assert window.txt_scratch_pad.toPlainText() == "Hello World"
```

**Toolbar Menu**

I came up with a simple method to allow user to create different step types. 
In the current form, it is a toolbar button with menu to expand depending on supporting types.

The code is pretty simple as well.
We are looping through available step types and create a new `QAction`.
Then a curried method is attached for each action which enables us to receive the step name when it gets triggered.

```python
    steps_menu = QMenu()
    for step in AVAILABLE_STEPS:
        s_action = QAction(step, self.main_window)
        s_action.triggered.connect(
            partial(self.main_window.steps_controller.add_step, step)
        )
        steps_menu.addAction(s_action)
```

And the method which gets triggered
```python
class StepsController:
    # ...
    
    def add_step(self, step_name):
        print("Adding step {}".format(step_name))
```

Then we create a new button with an icon and add it to toolbar.

```python
    toolbar_new_step_action = QAction(
        QIcon("://images/plus-48.png"), "New Step", self.main_window
    )
    toolbar_new_step_action.setMenu(steps_menu)
    self.toolbar.addAction(toolbar_new_step_action)
```

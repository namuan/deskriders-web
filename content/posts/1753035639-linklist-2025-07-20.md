```
Here is a comprehensive guide to writing style for technical documentation, based on the provided rules:

**General Guidelines**

1. **Be concise and clear**: Technical documentation should be easy to understand and free of unnecessary jargon.
2. **Use proper grammar and spelling**: Ensure that all text is grammatically correct and spelled correctly.
3. **Use proper punctuation**: Use commas, periods, semicolons, and other punctuation marks consistently throughout the document.

**Specific Guidelines**

1. **Subject-verb agreement**: Ensure that subject-verb agreement is used consistently throughout the document.
2. **Tense consistency**: Use a consistent tense (e.g., past, present, or future) when describing events.
3. **Use technical vocabulary correctly**: Use technical terms accurately and consistently throughout the document.
4. **Avoid contractions**: Avoid using contractions in technical documentation unless absolutely necessary.
5. **Use "I" sparingly**: Use the second person ("you") whenever possible to avoid using first-person pronouns (e.g., "I").
6. **Avoid passive voice**: Use active voice when describing actions and events.
7. **Use precise language**: Avoid using vague or ambiguous terms; instead, use specific and precise language to convey meaning.

**Style Conventions**

1. **Capitalization**: Capitalize the first word of each sentence and proper nouns (e.g., names of people, places, and organizations).
2. **Italicization**: Use italics for emphasis, such as for file paths or URLs.
3. **Bold formatting**: Use bold formatting to draw attention to important information, such as commands or options.
4. **Lists**: Use bullet points or numbered lists to present information in a clear and organized manner.

**Special Cases**

1. **Technical terms**: Use technical terms accurately and consistently throughout the document.
2. **Acronyms**: Define acronyms on their first use and use them consistently thereafter.
3. **Abbreviations**: Avoid using abbreviations unless absolutely necessary; if used, define them clearly.
4. **Examples**: Use examples to illustrate complex concepts or procedures.

**Red Flags**

1. **Ambiguous language**: Avoid using ambiguous terms that may be easily misinterpreted.
2. **Jargon overload**: Be cautious not to overwhelm the reader with too much technical jargon.
3. **Typos and errors**: Ensure that all text is error-free before publication.
4. **Outdated information**: Regularly review and update documentation to ensure accuracy and relevance.

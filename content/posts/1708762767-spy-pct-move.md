Last week, SPY jump over 2% on Thursday

This was surprising for many as the market is already up a lot.

So, I wanted to see what happened the next day when SPY jumped over 2%.

Here are the results over the last 10 years.

The next day change after a 2% jump

| Next Day Change | Number of Occurrences | Percentage |
|-----------------|-----------------------|------------|
| < 0             | 33                    | 55.93%     |
| > 0             | 25                    | 42.37%     |
| > 1 %           | 13                    | 22.03%     |
| > 2 %           | 3                     | 5.08%      |
| > 3 %           | 1                     | 1.69%      |

And the change after 5 days (about a week)

| Next Day Change | Number of Occurrences | Percentage |
|-----------------|-----------------------|------------|
| < 0             | 28                    | 47.46%     |
| > 0             | 32                    | 54.24%     |
| > 1 %           | 22                    | 37.29%     |
| > 2 %           | 9                     | 15.25%     |
| > 3 %           | 3                     | 5.08%      |

This doesn't tell us much, but it does give us a good indication of what is going on.
Next, I'm planning to overlay other indicators to say if this is a trend or not.

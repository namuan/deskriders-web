## Benjamin Franklin's House (Craven Street)
- **Comment**: "Benjamin Franklin's house, Craven street, a street away from Trafalgar Square. Visited a few years ago. It's a beautifully maintained Georgian house and his only residence left in the world still standing. Offers two tours - architecture or historical."
- **Comment**: "The historical tour is actor-led (playing the role of Polly Stevenson) and guided around the house and his life in London, with fantastic sound, lighting and projection effects in each room. It's totally unexpected."
- **Comment**: "It was just the two of us when we visited one Saturday morning, which is criminal with how fantastic the experience was. We still talk about it now!"

## Beekenham Place Park
- **Comment**: "Beckenham place park. Possibly one of the best parks in London(/Kent)!"

## Bunhill Fields Burial Ground
- **Comment**: "Bunhill Fields burial ground just south of Old St tube is a lovely quiet spot. Such a contrast to the industry and modern buildings around it, it's so very London."
- **Comment**: "It has a really interesting history as well. It was a mass burial ground for people who died from plague in the Middle Ages (Bunhill = Bone Hill), and it was one of most dangerously overcrowded cemeteries in the Victorian times which forced Parliament into changing how they buried the dead in London. It also has some mortsafe graves (which deterred body snatchers) and some famous people are buried there."
- **Comment**: "I was once walking down Bunhill Row and a fox walked next to me on the other side of the fence in the graveyard side staring at me. Genuinely one of the most unsettling things that's happened to me."

## Cabinet War Rooms (Whitehall)
- **Comment**: "The Longitude Exhibition at Greenwich. Fascinating. Also, better known but definitely worth mentioning is the Cabinet War Rooms in Whitehall."

## Capital Ring Walk
- **Comment**: "The Capital Ring Walk. So many little gems to see that you'd never discover otherwise, and all the sections start and finish at Tube stations so it's really easy to get to. Absolutely loved it, and would recommend to anyone."

- **Comment**: "They have had money from the lottery and a heritage fund, the dinosaurs are getting restored!!"
- **Comment**: "That place is fascinating - I read that what they thought they looked like was absolutely scientifically valid given the fossil record at the time. Specifically assuming the legs come out to the side, like many modern reptiles, as opposed to underneath."
- **Comment**: "Did all my swimming training at Crystal Palace. Some of our land training consisted of running passed those dinosaurs at 5.30 am. (Adopts a hushed tone) They watched us, I'm telling you ... 👀"

## Dulwich Picture Gallery

But there is a great American bar half way down the arches too. Great for seeing some amazing street art that is constantly changing."

## The Pergola (Hampstead Heath)
- **Comment**: "The pergola in Hampstead Heath I discovered by accident a few years back and was shocked at how under-appreciated it was (I'd never heard anyone mention it in all the time I'd lived here). A total slice of paradise which makes you forget you're in a major city. Has a different character in each season as well, being just as beautiful in the rain as it is in the sun."
- **Comment**: "Shhhhh! Don't reveal this little gem!"
- **Comment**: "You obviously have not been there in the last 5 years. It's not quiet now."
- **Comment**: "Good shout! I lived in halls near there as a student in 1999-2001 and found them while wandering on the heath. The wisteria in bloom is insane. And there's the Golders Green petting zoo on the other side!"

## The Philpot Lane Cheese Mice
- **Comment**: "The Philpot Lane cheese Mice"

## Postman's Park
- **Comment**: "I love Postman's Park in the city. Lovely little spot with some plaques dedicated to people who gave their lives helping others. Think George Cross, but before the GC was introduced. Closest tube is Barbican or St. Paul's."

## The Postal Railway (Post Office Museum Railway)
- **Comment**: "Post office museum railway. Get to go round in abandoned tunnels in a little postal train, crazy to think that's how the post used to get around"
- **Comment**: "My Grandad used to work in the tunnels and used to tell me how there is another London underneath. Especially around Barbican"
- **Comment**: "My granddad was a policeman from the 60s - 80s and mentioned this too. He mentioned a nondescript door just south of the river somewhere which leads down to them."

## Southwark Cathedral
- **Comment**: "Southwark Cathedral, it's right next to borough market which in my opinion is over-rated, but I feel like the cathedral is overloked, it's way nicer than st pauls in my opinion and it's free and generally a nice respite from the hustle of London Bridge."
- **Comment**: "A somewhat similar kind of place is st martin in the fields on trafalgar square."
- **Comment**: "St Martin's also has a really nice cafe downstairs."

## St Martin in the Fields (Trafalgar Square)

## Stave Hill (Bermondsey)
- **Comment**: "Stave hill down in Bermondsey. But go in the dark, or at least stay until it is."
- **Comment**: "You're in a quiet place in an ecological park. Loads of foxes. Then you stand in Stave Hill and you're right across the river from the great temple to Mammon that is Canary Wharf. Turn round a little and you are only like a mile away from the other great temple to Mammon that is the City if London. Yet here you are in the peaceful darkness. It's the dichotomy of it that is so striking."
- **Comment**: "Do take a camera."

## The Thames Barrier
- **Comment**: "The Thames Barrier and Crossness Pumping Station"

## Wapping Market (Shadwell Basin)
- **Comment**: "Something that is both delightful and local. For example, Wapping Market in Shadwell Basin on a Saturday."

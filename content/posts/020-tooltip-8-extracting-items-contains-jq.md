In this short clip, we'll continue looking at jq to extract a nested array item along with using the 'contains' function to partially match an attribute value.

#### Requirements:

* jq: https://stedolan.github.io/jq/

📝:

👉 Tested on MacOS Mojave but should work on earlier versions and all flavours of Linux

👉 Although `jq` is really powerful but watch out for over using it. It is probably more easier to achieve the same thing in a proper language.

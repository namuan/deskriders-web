Summary from [this tweet](https://x.com/laurensbensdorp/status/1867255454373486768?s=12) from Laurens Bensdorp

Here's what seems to matter most:

### Core Performance Metrics:
* CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and its variants
* CAGR/UI (Ulcer Index) ratio
* CAGR/MaxDD (Maximum Drawdown)
* Some use RAR (Risk-Adjusted Return) instead of CAGR for more date-independent analysis
* Risk Management Metrics:

### Maximum Drawdown
* Average Exposure (particularly important for mean reversion strategies)
* Drawdown Correlation
* Total Drawdown
* Ulcer Index
* Trade Quality Indicators:

### Profit Factor
* Expectancy
* System Quality Number (SQN)
* Win Ratio
* Standard Deviation of Returns
* Coefficient of Variation
* Strategy-Specific Considerations:

#### For Stocks:

* Individual trade statistics
* Capital utilization efficiency
* Average capital use per trade

#### For Futures:

* Risk metrics
* Drawdown analysis
* Trend gain patterns

### Advanced Analysis:

* Walk-forward testing results consistency
* Performance during "black swan" events (1987 crash, flash crashes)
* Stagnation periods
* Monthly Return on Risk (RoR)
* Monthly dollar performance

### Evaluation Method Tip:

Some traders use conditional formatting with color ranking to aggregate multiple metrics, helping identify top-performing systems more easily.

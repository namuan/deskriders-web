It was a strange day and certainly not good for short straddles. 
The market went up without taking any stops

**XSP Sep 17th 7DTE Short Straddle**

## Experiments

Some trades that I'm following to learn and try out other strategies.

**/ESU24 Sep 12th 1 DTE Short Straddle**

1 DTE Expiry so it is more risky but would like to try out adjustments.
Also will close it at > 5% PT and ~20% SL

Closed it for **-$3,979** return since Sep 11, 2024, 4:17 PM

**SPX Sep 17th 7 DTE IronFly**

Started as IronFly yesterday and turned into Iron Condor today after adjustment to expand the area.

Closed for **-$5,700** return since Sep 10, 2024, 8:14 PM

**/ESU24 Sep 13th 1DTE Short Straddle**

Closed for **+$181** return since Sep 12, 2024, 2:53 PM

**/ESU24 Sep 16th 2DTE Short Straddle**

Opened this morning and had to do an adjustment due to price keep moving up.

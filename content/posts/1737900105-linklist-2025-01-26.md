## https://eamag.me/2025/Voice-Cloning

* Recently a post about generating audiobooks started trending on hn, and some people in the comments wished they could clone their voice and narrate text without sending it off their machine. It’s never been easier!
* For this example, we only need a mac, uv (modern python package manager), ffmpeg for audio processing and optionally chatgpt for transcribing your voice (but you can do it manually or use mlx-whisper, for example).
* We will be using F5-TTS-MLX, an open-source speech synthesis implementation of F5 TTS model in Apple Silicon array framework
* The final result: Compare to the original source video with him. The source quality is very important!
* Step by step guide:
    * Install ffmpeg anduv using viabrew install ffmpeg uv
    * Create some directory and initialize a uv package with `mdiir voiceclone && cd voiceclone && uv init`
    * Download a video using yt-dlp like `uvx yt-dlp -x —audio-format wav -o out.wav https://www.youtube.com/shorts/S0gEZ72uBWU`
    * Convert the audio to a suitable format with `ffmpeg -i out.wav -ac 1 -ar 24000 -sample_fmt s16 -t 10 sample.wav`
    * Get a reference text for this audio, either manually or by transcribing the audio using ChatGPT/Whisper/Gemini
    * Run the following command: `uv run -m f5_tts_mlx.generate --ref-audio sample.wav --ref-text "your desired text" --output gen.wav --text "your desired text"`
* Going beyond:
    * The original implementation has support for multiple languages.
    * The MLX implementation includes a duration predictor specifically for English, which simplifies the creation of natural-sounding audio.

## https://www.qodo.ai/blog/rag-for-large-scale-code-repos/

The article discusses the challenges of implementing a search system (RAG) for massive enterprise codebases and presents a solution that addresses these challenges. Here are some key points:

**Challenges**

1. **Noise and inefficiency**: Searching across all repositories becomes noisy and inefficient as the number of repositories grows.
2. **Lack of standardization**: Evaluating the performance of RAG systems is challenging due to the lack of standardized benchmarks.

**Solution**

1. **Intelligent chunking**: The system uses intelligent chunking techniques to break down large codebases into smaller, more manageable pieces (chunks).
2. **Enhanced embeddings**: It generates natural language descriptions for each code chunk, which are then embedded alongside the code.
3. **Advanced retrieval techniques**: The system performs a two-stage retrieval process, using an LLM to filter and rank results based on relevance.
4. **Scalable architectures**: The system is designed to scale with growing repository sizes, using repo-level filtering strategies and "golden repos" (designated repositories that align with best practices).

**Key Techniques**

1. **LLM-generated descriptions**: Natural language descriptions are generated for each code chunk, improving retrieval for natural language queries.
2. **Two-stage retrieval process**: The system uses an LLM to filter and rank results based on relevance, reducing noise and improving accuracy.

**Evaluation and Benchmarking**

1. **Multi-faceted evaluation approach**: The system evaluates performance using a combination of automated metrics (relevance scoring, accuracy metrics, efficiency measurements) and real-world usage data from enterprise clients.
2. **Golden repos**: Repositories are designated as "golden" based on metadata and high-level content analysis to narrow down the search space.

## https://github.com/jbellis/llmap

* LLMap is a CLI code search tool designed to solve the problem of finding context for editing code by asking DeepSeek-V3 and DeepSeek-R1 about the relevance of each source file.
* LLMap performs its analysis in stages: coarse analysis using code skeletons, full source analysis of potentially relevant files, and refining the output to only the most relevant snippets.
* Only Java and Python files are currently supported by the skeletonization pass, but other languages can be processed with slower full source analysis.
* LLMap optimizes the problem by using a multi-stage analysis to avoid spending more time than necessary on obviously irrelevant files.
* The tool caches LLM responses in ~/.cache/llmap to prevent rate limiting issues and reduce reprocessing time.
* Commandline parameters include --sample, --llm-concurrency, --no-refine, --no-skeletons, and others.
* Environment variables such as LLMAP_CACHE, LLMAP_ANALYZE_MODEL, and LLMAP_REFINE_MODEL can be set to customize the tool's behavior.
* The tool prints the most relevant context found to stdout, and errors are logged to stderr.

## https://idinsight.github.io/tech-blog/blog/enhancing_maternal_healthcare/

This text describes a research project on using artificial intelligence (AI) to improve maternal health support in developing regions. The project, led by IDinsight, MomConnect, and Google.org, aims to leverage AI to identify and prioritize urgent messages, thereby improving the responsiveness and effectiveness of maternal healthcare services.

Here are some key points from the text:

1. **Project overview**: The project uses advanced technology to integrate community-based healthcare with AI-powered solutions.
2. **Objective**: The main objective is to improve the responsiveness and effectiveness of maternal healthcare services by leveraging AI to identify and prioritize urgent messages.
3. **Methodology**: The researchers fine-tuned a pre-trained language model (Gemma-2) using a small, high-quality dataset of synthetic user messages, ensuring that each message aligns with its selected urgency rule with high confidence.
4. **Results**: The researchers benchmarked their fine-tuned model against the GPT-family of models from OpenAI and achieved competitive performance, outperforming the base Gemma-2 2-billion instruction model.
5. **Future directions**: To improve upon the results, the authors suggest three avenues for future research:
    * Increasing the size and diversity of the training dataset to reduce overfitting.
    * Incorporating ambiguous messages into the preference optimization process to improve handling of uncertain cases.
    * Fine-tuning a larger, more advanced language model (Gemma-2 9-billion) to tap into its potential for emergent capabilities.
6. **Benefits**: The project has the potential to set a new standard for maternal health support, providing a scalable and private solution to address challenges in developing regions.

The text concludes by acknowledging Google.org's funding and providing valuable insights throughout the process, and invites readers to explore the publicly available dataset and model to further collaborate on advancing maternal healthcare globally.

## https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1i81ev6/deepseek_added_recommandations_for_r1_local_use/

* DeepSeek added recommandations for R1 local use to model card https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B#usage-recommendations
* We recommend adhering to the following configurations when utilizing the DeepSeek-R1 series models, including benchmarking, to achieve the expected performance:
* 1. Set the temperature within the range of 0.5-0.7 (0.6 is recommended) to prevent endless repetitions or incoherent outputs.
* 2. Avoid adding a system prompt; all instructions should be contained within the user prompt.
* 3. For mathematical problems, it is advisable to include a directive in your prompt such as: "Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \boxed{}."
* 4. When evaluating model performance, it is recommended to conduct multiple tests and average the results.

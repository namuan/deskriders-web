## https://github.com/jbellis/brokk/

```
- Brokk: first code assistant that understands code semantically, designed for large codebases
- Run using jbang (recommended): install jbang and run `jbang run brokk@jbellis/brokk` or download JAR and run manually
- Features:
  - Agentic search/code retrieval
  - Automatically capture context from search results
  - Capture/incorporate external context using "Run" combined with "Capture Text"/"Edit Files"
  - Undo includes filesystem changes
  - Use History Panel to keep track, undo, or redo changes
- Scenarios:
  - Identify commit causing regression using `git bisect`
  - Load commit and files changed by that commit as editable context
  - Tell LLM to look at changes to see what could cause problem
- Real-world tasks:
  - Make complex, multi-file edits with o1pro
  - Use Brokk to help with poorly documented dependencies
  - Summarize classes using `Summarize Fields` and use globbing
- Limitations:
  - "Stop" button not working reliably during search (langchain4j/langchain4j#2658)
  - Joern needs to run delombok before analysis can begin
  - No automatic running of tests

## https://github.com/scaliseraoul/ambrogio

```
* Ambrogio is an intelligent dev agent that helps tackle technical debt in your codebase.
* It systematically enhances code quality and maintainability through automated analysis and improvements.
* Starting with docstring improvements, Ambrogio uses advanced language models to understand your code and generate meaningful documentation.
* Features:
  * Smart Docstring Generation: Automatically adds clear, comprehensive docstrings to classes and methods
  * Multi-Provider Support: Works with various LLM providers through LiteLLM integration
  * Unit Test Generation (Beta): Analyzes code coverage and generates missing unit tests
  * Pre-PR test runs to prevent regressions
  * Improve existing docstrings in modified methods
  * Documentation generation for easier understanding
  * Type safety refactoring
  * Spaghetti code cleanup
  * Code formatting and best practices enforcement
```

## https://github.com/jendrikseipp/vulture

```
Vulture is a tool that analyzes Python code to identify unused imports, variables, functions, and other code elements.

**Features**

1. **Unused import detection**: Finds unused imports in the analyzed code.
2. **Unused variable detection**: Detects unused variables, including global and local ones.
3. **Unused function detection**: Identifies unused functions.
4. **Unreachable code detection**: Finds unreachable code, such as code after `return`, `break`, `continue`, or `raise` statements.

**How it works**

Vulture uses the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) module to build a tree representation of the analyzed code. It then traverses this tree and records the names of defined and used objects. The tool reports the objects that have been defined but not used, which are considered dead code.

```
# Autogrep Tool

* Autogrep is a tool for automatically generating and filtering Semgrep rules from vulnerability patches.
* It addresses the need for high-quality security rules after Sem Gregg's official rules are no longer available under permissive licenses.
* Autogrep leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate rule generation and validation.

* Supports YouTube URLs, MP4, and MP3 files
* Outputs transcribed text in .txt format
```

## https://github.com/duriantaco/pykomodo

```
* **ParallelChunker**: A class used to split a large codebase into equal chunks suitable for Large Language Models (LLMs).
* **Code Chunking**: The process of dividing a large codebase into smaller, more manageable chunks.
* **LLM Context Windows**: The size of the context window for LLMs, which determines how much code is processed at once.

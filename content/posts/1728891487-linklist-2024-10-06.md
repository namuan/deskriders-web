Mick Colburn, a trader on X, shared an interview he liked with @TradesTurbo and @RealSimpleAriel. The interview discussed a trading strategy that uses a 50-day Moving Average (MA) / ATR multiple rule, which reminds him of what @jfsrevg speaks about. Colburn believes it's worth looking into as multiple successful traders have endorsed the strategy. He shared the tweet with his followers and encouraged them to check out the interview on youtube.com.

It appears that the conversation is about summarizing conversations, specifically asking if there is a model that can summarize conversations by any chance.

The user, custodiam99, has shared an example of a model called LM Studio Standard, which takes in a large input (~100 000 letters to the last punctuation mark) and generates a summary. The original post also mentions a conversation about summarizing conversations.

Another user, Southern_Sun_2106, is asking if there is a model that can summarize conversations, specifically for Reddit discussions.

The comments section has some discussion about this topic, with custodiam99 mentioning that they don't have a specific model in mind but are interested in exploring the idea. There are also some general questions and discussions about summarization models and their capabilities.

Overall, it seems like users are looking for ways to improve conversation summarization, and are open to exploring new ideas and technologies.

This video is a tutorial on how to create 3D elevation and river maps using the rayShader package in R.

Here is a summary of the steps involved in creating a 3D elevation river map of Switzerland using the rayShader package:

Install and load the necessary packages.
Fetch the national boundaries and in this tutorial, we will be creating the 3D elevation river map of Switzerland.
Fetch the Rivers Data from the hydr database.
Load this into our.
Determine what exactly are the orders of rivers that exist for Switzerland.
Simplify making sure that this is going to be an SF object.
Transform so transform into this new coordinat reference system for Switzerland.
Fetch the digital elevation model and for that purpose, we will be using once more the elevator package which has a convenient function get L rer for getting for any part of the world.
Transform this into a tera rust object.
Reproject this one into that cordance reference system that we use.
Zoom out using now 75.
Render and then save our object as an image.

    - Key component of agentic applications with endless possibilities
    - Implementation in notebook, ToolAgent class, and Tool class
    - YouTube video available for explanation

- Planning Pattern üß†
    - Enables LLM to break tasks into smaller, manageable subgoals

```text

The article discusses the "Islands Architecture" pattern, which involves using a combination of server-side and client-side rendering to build single-page web applications. The author experimented with this approach using hypermedia, specifically htmx, a JavaScript library that enables building modern user interfaces with simplicity and power.

Here are some key points from the article:

1.  **Islands Architecture**: This pattern involves breaking down a single-page application into smaller, focused chunks of interactivity within server-rendered web pages.
2.  **Hypermedia**: The author chose htmx as the hypermedia library for this project because it provides access to AJAX, CSS Transitions, WebSockets, and Server Sent Events directly in HTML using attributes.
3.  **Service Worker**: The service worker is used to handle requests from the client-side and interact with the server. In this example, it's responsible for sending data to the server when the user submits the todo list.
4.  **Client-Side Rendering**: The client-side rendering is handled by htmx, which generates the HTML for each "island" of interaction.

The article also discusses some alternatives to using htmx, including:

1.  **Mavo**: A new approachable way to create web applications that explicitly focus on this use case.
2.  **HyperCard-esque App**: Building a whole application visually using a tool like HyperCard.

Overall, the author concludes that building a single-page app with htmx was fun and allowed them to experiment with a new technique. They hope to encourage readers to try using their tools in unexpected ways.

Rivers curve because of a process called meandering.
Meandering is caused by a disturbance in the river's flow, such as a burrow from a muskrat.
The disturbance causes the water to flow faster on one side of the river than the other.
This faster flow erodes the bank on the outside of the curve, while the slower flow deposits sediment on the inside of the curve.
This process continues until the river has formed a large S-curve.
The S-curve is called a meander.
Meanders can be found all over the world, in rivers of all sizes.
The length of a meander is typically about six times the width of the river channel.
Meanders can eventually become so curved that they loop around and form an oxbow lake.
Oxbow lakes are crescent-shaped lakes that are left behind when a river changes its course.

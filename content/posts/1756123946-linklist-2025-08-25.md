```markdown
* Scaling a FastAPI service from 0-10000 req/s was accomplished using the following optimizations:
*   - Leveraging Python's asynchronous programming capabilities for non-blocking I/O operations with libraries like aio boto3 and httpx.
*   - Optimizing read patterns by batching ScyllaDB queries into single requests to minimize network round-trips and prevent event loop stalls.
*   - Minimizing data validation overhead using dataclasses instead of Pydantic models, especially when working with large volumes of data.
*   - Improving garbage collection efficiency by fine-tuning Python's memory management settings for high-throughput applications.
*   - Adopting a deployment strategy that utilizes topology spread constraints and node selectors to ensure optimal resource utilization in distributed systems.

These optimizations significantly improved the performance of the FastAPI service, including:
*   Reduced p99 latency under 10ms
*   Increased throughput by over 50%
*   Improved overall system stability and reliability

```
* # Building Reliable Agentic Systems: Part I
*  *There’s always been a gap between demo and realistic application.*
*  *With Gen AI, it has widened to a gulf.*
*  *Agent demos accompanied by exaggerated claims are plentiful. Yet agentic success stories are thin on the ground, at least in enterprise.*
*  *We can bridge the gap between promise and reality by applying what we’ve learnt about software engineering over time.*
*   *Some things don’t change.*
*   # Travel Planner Functionality
*   *Tripper is a journey planner, originally created to plan a road trip for myself and my girlfriend.*
*   *Given start and destination and desired dates, information about the travelers and a travel brief, it builds a personalized day to day plan.*
*   *It suggests activities, chooses places to stay and searches Airbnb for each location.*
*   # Supporting Services
*   *Generating this quality of output requires not just LLMs, but multiple integrations.*
*   *The supporting cast:*
*     - Multiple LLMs: We need a high quality LLM for generating itinerary ideas and writing up the final proposal.*
*     - Tools for LLMs to use. MCP tools (backed by Docker MCP gateway) for web search, Google maps and Airbnb; the Embabel platform built in math tool to allow distance and other calculations.* 
*   # The Hard Part: Making Tripper Reliable
*   *You could throw all these tools at a large state of the art LLM and let it decide how to call them, in what a skeptical NVIDIA paper calls language model agency.*
*   *Experience building Tripper showed that this would not produce acceptable results.*
*   *Gotchas included:*
*     - Invalid generated URLs. 
*     - Confusion around images.* 
*     - Inconsistent tool usage.*
*    - Poor choice of tool arguments.*

## https://github.com/hwchase17/deepagents

```
* Using an LLM to call tools in a loop is a simple way to create an agent, but it can lead to shallow agents that struggle with complex tasks.
* The DeepAgents library solves this limitation by implementing four key components:
	+ A planning tool
	+ Sub-agents
	+ Access to a file system
	+ A detailed prompt
```

## https://github.com/FareedKhan-dev/train-llm-from-scratch

This is a thorough analysis of two large language models (LLMs), one with 13 million parameters and another with 1 billion parameters. The author provides an in-depth comparison of their strengths and weaknesses, highlighting both the benefits and limitations of each model.

**Key Takeaways:**

1. **Smaller model can be effective**: The 13 million-parameter model is able to generate clear and accurate text, even in longer contexts, making it a viable option for goal-oriented tasks.
2. **Bigger model requires deeper architecture**: The 1 billion-parameter model's ability to handle complex contexts and generate coherent text relies on a more sophisticated architecture that requires careful consideration of its design and training data.
3. **Overfitting is a risk**: If the bigger model is not designed with sufficient depth and complexity, it may overfit the training data and fail to improve performance compared to smaller models.
4. **Fine-tuning can improve performance**: Fine-tuning the 1 billion-parameter model on domain-specific data, such as writing emails or essays, can help improve its ability to generate high-quality text.

**Recommendations:**

1. **Create a smaller, goal-oriented LLM**: Build an LLM with 13 million parameters that can handle specific tasks, such as generating email responses or writing essays.
2. **Fine-tune the bigger model**: Train the 1 billion-parameter model on domain-specific data to improve its ability to generate high-quality text and adapt to new contexts.

**Implications:**

1. **Larger models are not always better**: While larger models can handle more complex tasks, they require more computational resources and may overfit the training data if not designed carefully.
2. **Deeper architectures are crucial**: A more sophisticated architecture is necessary to support the vast amount of parameters in large LLMs, ensuring that they can learn and generalize effectively.

Overall, this analysis highlights the importance of considering the trade-offs between model size, complexity, and performance when building large language models. By understanding these factors, developers can create effective models that balance computational efficiency with high-quality text generation capabilities.

## https://dzone.com/articles/fresh-data-ai-spring-ai-function-calls

This article reviews how to integrate Spring Boot's AI features into an Angular application using Angular Material Tree component.

1. The Spring Boot side creates an API that accepts input from the user and responds with the results in different formats (e.g., plain text, JSON).
2. It uses Spring Boot's `@PostMapping` annotation to map incoming requests to methods that calculate or retrieve data.
3. The `postLibraryFunction` method is used to send a request to the API, specifying the input question and desired response format.

**Angular Side**

1. The Angular Material Tree component is used to display the results in a structured way.
2. The tree component's `dataSource`, `hasChild`, and `treeControl` properties are set up to work with the structured data from Spring Boot.
3. The `search` method fetches new data every 100 milliseconds until it receives a response from the backend, displaying a loading message.
4. When the response is received, the results are mapped into the tree's data source using `addToDataSource` and `mapResult`.
5. The `hasChild` function checks if each node in the tree has children that can be opened.

* Tree-sitter is a powerful and performant parser generator library implemented in C and optimized for cross-platforms.
* It supports grammar for most popular high-level programming languages.
* It also supports bindings for multiple languages to be integrated with any type of application.

## https://github.com/jbellis/llmap

* Tools like Aider and Cursor are great at editing code for you once you give them the right context, but finding that context automatically is largely an unsolved problem in large codebases.
* LLMap is a CLI code search tool designed to solve this by asking DeepSeek-V3 and DeepSeek-R1 to evaluate the relevance of each source file in your codebase to your problem.
* Until recently, this would be prohibitively expensive and slow, but DeepSeek-V3 is cheap, smart, fast, and allows multiple concurrent requests.
* LLMap performs analysis 500 files at a time, making it reasonably fast even for large codebases.
* The tool uses caching from DeepSeek to speed up repeated searches against the same files.
* It optimizes the problem by using a multi-stage analysis:
  - Coarse analysis using code skeletons (DeepSeek-V3)
  - Full source analysis of potentially relevant files
  - Refining the output to only the most relevant snippets (DeepSeek-R1)
* Currently, Java and Python files are supported through skeletonization, but other languages can be processed without skeletonization.
* Contributions are welcome to extend parsing to other languages.
* Install with `pip install llmap-ai` and obtain a DeepSeek API key from platform.deepseek.com.
* Example command: `find src/ -name "*.java" | llmap "Where is the database connection configured?"`
* LLM APIs can be rate-limited, so LLMap caches responses in `~/.cache/llmap`.
* Print output to stdout or save to a file for use with AI chat tools.
* Errors are logged to stderr.
* Options include:
  - `--no-refine` and `--no-skeletons` to adjust the analysis
  - Commandline parameters: `--sample`, `--llm-concurrency`
  - Environment variables: `LLMAP_CACHE` and `LLMAP_ANALYZE_MODEL`

## https://huggingface.co/blog/smolagents-can-see

This is a comprehensive guide on how to create a CodeAgent that can interact with the web using a vision-enabled model, specifically the Qwen2VL via Fireworks API. The agent uses the Helium framework to interact with the web and capture screenshots.

Here's a high-level overview of the steps involved:

1. **Setting up the environment**: The guide sets up the necessary environment by installing Helium and smolagents.
2. **Defining the model**: A Qwen2VL via Fireworks API model is defined using the OpenAIServerModel class from smolagents.
3. **Defining the agent**: A CodeAgent is created with a model, tools (e.g., `go_back`, `close_popups`, `search_item_ctrl_f`), step callbacks (e.g., `save_screenshot`), and verbosity levels set to 2 for full output messages.
4. **Providing guidance**: Helium instructions are provided to help the agent navigate the web and use its tools effectively.
5. **Running the agent**: The agent is run with a sample task that requires it to navigate to a GitHub trending page, find the top author's profile, and retrieve their total number of commits over the last year.

The guide also includes some general tips and best practices for using the CodeAgent, such as:

* Using `.exists()` to check if an element exists
* Not trying to solve tasks in one shot, but rather proceeding in several steps
* Avoiding code-based element searches like `find_all(S("ol > li"))` and instead relying on visual inspection of the latest screenshot
* Being cautious when using `time.sleep()` to wait for pages to load

Overall, this guide provides a comprehensive introduction to creating a CodeAgent that can interact with the web using a vision-enabled model.

## https://timkellogg.me/blog/2025/01/25/r1

This article discusses the rapid progress in artificial intelligence (AI) research and its implications on geopolitics and software regulation. Here's a summary of the key points:

**Recent Breakthroughs**

1. R1, an AI model developed by DeepSeek, has achieved significant improvements in reasoning and inference speed, making it one of the most accurate models available.
2. The article suggests that OpenAI's GPT-4o is likely a distillation of R1, but the exact relationship between the two models is unclear.

**Scaling Laws**

The article identifies several scaling laws in AI research:

1. **Pre-training**: Pre-training has become increasingly difficult, but not impossible.
2. **Inference scaling**: Models are becoming smaller and faster, making them more efficient at inference time.
3. **Downsizing models**: Smaller models are being developed that can produce similar results to larger models.
4. **Reinforcement learning (RL) scaling laws**: RL is emerging as a key factor in improving model performance.

**Model Distillation**

The article discusses the concept of model distillation, where a student model is trained using training data from a teacher model. This process can help improve model performance and efficiency.

**Geopolitics: Distealing**

The author introduces the term "distealing," referring to unauthorized distillation of AI models. The article notes that there are tensions between China and the USA over AI development, with China pursuing cheaper solutions while the USA invests heavily in AI research.

**Strategies**

The article outlines three strategies:

1. **USA**: Invest heavily in AI research to stay ahead.
2. **China**: Focus on developing cheaper AI solutions using smart engineers and researchers.
3. **Europe**: Regulate or open-source AI to ensure accountability and fairness.

**Conclusion**

The article concludes that the rapid progress in AI research is accelerating rapidly, and the future of AI is more clear than ever before. The main takeaway is that R1 provides clarity where OpenAI was previously opaque, making it a significant milestone in the development of AI.

## https://www.philschmid.de/mini-deepseek-r1

This is a detailed report on a research experiment using Reinforcement Learning (RL) with the DeepSeek R1 methodology, specifically targeting the Countdown Game task. The experiment uses the GRPO (Generalized Reward Proximal Optimize) algorithm and two rule-based rewards to train a 3B parameter model on the game. Here's a summary of the report:

**Methodology**

* The experiment uses the GRPO algorithm with two rule-based rewards: one for the correct format `<think>...</think>\n<answer>...</answer>` and another for successful equation solving.
* The reward functions are not explicitly defined, instead relying on the model to learn through trial and error.
* The model is trained using a 3B parameter base model (Qwen 2.5 3B).
* The experiment uses 4 H100 GPUs in distributed training mode, with a total of 6 hours of compute time.

**Results**

* At around 50 steps, the model learns to recognize and use the correct format `<think>...</think>\n<answer>...</answer>`.
* By step 100, the success rate for solving equations reaches around 25%.
* By step 200, the performance converges, with a success rate of around 40%. The model starts to "reason" using words.
* At step 450, the success rate has increased to around 50%, but the performance still improves slowly. The model adopts a new format, similar to programmatic execution.

1. **Web Browser**: A simple text-based web browser is used as a starting point for our proof-of-concept.
2. **Text Inspector**: A tool to read and inspect text files, taken from Microsoft Research's Magentic-One agent.
3. **Code-Native Agent**: Agents write their actions in code instead of JSON, which leads to improved performance.

* The $6 R1 Competitor? Tim Kellogg shares his notes on a new paper, s1: Simple test-time scaling, which describes an inference-scaling model fine-tuned on top of Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct for just $6.
* After sifting their dataset of 56K examples down to just the best 1K, they found that the core 1K is all that's needed to achieve o1-preview performance on a 32B model.
* The paper describes a technique called "Budget forcing":
	+ To enforce a minimum, suppress the generation of the end-of-thinking token delimiter
	+ Optionally append the string “Wait” to the model’s current reasoning trace to encourage reflection
* This is the same trick previously described by Theia Vogel
* A 32B model on Hugging Face can be run using Ollama like so: ollama run hf.co/brittlewis12/s1-32B-GGUF:Q4_0
* 1,000 samples are available in the simplescaling/s1K data repository on Hugging Face
* CSV file conversion and manipulation was done using DuckDB and sqlite-utils

## https://github.com/suvakov/chargraph

* Let's try a small experiment with LLMs: feed an entire book into the context window and ask it to generate a list of characters, their relationships, and physical descriptions—data that can later be used for image generation.
* Script chargraph.py is used to extract characters and relationships.
* Supports Gemini and OpenRouter API
* Character images were generated using portrait_prompt from JSON.
* Model: Gemini 2.0 Flash Exp
* Specs: 1M token context window, 8K token output limit
* Results are visualized in HTML/JS using D3
* Uses text files downloaded from Project Gutenberg
* Small books (Tom Sawyer and Peter Pan) are processed surprisingly well.
* Iterative approach helps refine results and adds some missing links and characters.
* 8K token output limit is a bottleneck, making it challenging to process large books like Les Misérables.
* Multiple copies of a book don't help with results when possible to fit in the prompt.
* Improve prompt
* Test other large context window models.
* Find 'ground truth' character networks using more sophisticated analysis and use it as benchmark for large context models.
* Try it on legal documents (affidavits, indictments), historical documents, and movie/TV show scripts.

## https://www.superagent.sh/blog/reag-reasoning-augmented-generation

* ReAG (Reasoning-Augmented Generation): A method that skips traditional retrieval steps and directly feeds raw materials to language models for synthesis of answers in one go.
* Traditional RAG systems have three core issues:
    + Semantic search isn't smart enough.
    + Infrastructure complexity.
    + Static knowledge.
* ReAG operates on a simple idea: Let the language model do the heavy lifting by analyzing raw documents and asking two questions: Is this document useful for the task? What specific parts of it matter?
* This approach mirrors how humans research: Skim sources, discard irrelevant ones, and focus on passages that address our specific question.
* ReAG is like a scholar, reading every book in full, underlining relevant paragraphs, and synthesizing insights based on the query's deeper intent.
* Key design choices:
    + Document-Level Analysis: The LLM processes entire documents, preserving cross-paragraph context.
    + Dynamic Prompts: System instructions focus the model's reasoning.
* ReAG's strengths become clear in scenarios where context matters more than speed:
    + Complex, open-ended queries
    + Dynamic data
    + Multimodal data
* Cheaper, faster language models and larger context windows will improve ReAG's viability.
* Hybrid systems may emerge to balance speed and accuracy.
* Conclusion: ReAG is about rethinking how language models interact with knowledge, aligning better with human analysis methods.

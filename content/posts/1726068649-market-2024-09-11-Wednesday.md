## Experiments

Some trades that I'm following to learn and try out other strategies

**/ESU24 Sep 12th 1 DTE Short Straddle**

1 DTE Expiry so it is more risky but would like to try out adjustments.
Also will close it at > 5% PT and ~20% SL

**SPX Sep 17th 7 DTE IronFly**

Started as IronFly yesterday and turned into Iron Condor today after adjustment to expand the area.

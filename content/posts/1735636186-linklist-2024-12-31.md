## https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/11/gemini-2/

This article discusses the latest updates to Google's Gemini AI model, specifically Gemini 2.0 Flash. The author is excited about the new features and capabilities of this version, which includes:

1. **Improved spatial understanding**: The model can now return bounding boxes around objects in images, even for complex photographs.
2. **Code execution**: The model can write and execute Python code, running it and considering the result as part of its response.
3. **Streaming API**: A new two-way stream allows for real-time audio and video input, with text and audio output in return.

The author is impressed by these features and believes they are "straight out of science fiction." They also note that OpenAI's WebSocket streaming API was released recently, but it only handles audio and is currently expensive to use.

Some things to look forward to include:

1. **Multi-modal image output**: Models will be able to do fine-grained image editing, which has been a long-term goal for diffusion-based image models.
2. **Native audio output**: Gemini 2.0 Flash will be able to produce high-quality audio output with different voices, intonations, languages, and accents.

The author also shares some thoughts on the potential applications of these features, such as:

1. **Conversational AI**: Being able to have an audio conversation with a capable LLM about things that it can "see" through your camera is a powerful tool.
2. **Advertising**: The ability to serve targeted ads based on voice recognition and other forms of surveillance raises concerns.

## https://ollama.com/blog/structured-outputs

```
- Structured outputs are available in Ollama, allowing models' outputs to be constrained to a specific format defined by a JSON schema.
- The Ollama Python and JavaScript libraries have been updated to support structured outputs.

- Use cases include:
    - Parsing data from documents
    - Extracting data from images
    - Structuring all language model responses
    - More reliability and consistency than JSON mode

- Tips for reliable use of structured outputs include:
    - Using Pydantic (Python) or Zod (JavaScript) to define the schema for the response
    - Adding ‚Äúreturn as JSON‚Äù to the prompt to help the model understand the request
    - Setting the temperature to 0 for more deterministic output

- Future plans include:
    - Exposing logits for controlled generation
    - Performance and accuracy improvements for structured outputs
    - GPU acceleration for sampling
    - Additional format support beyond JSON schema
```

```
* Swiped: The School that Banned Smartphones is based at The Stanway School in Colchester and challenged a group of Year 8 pupils to give up their smartphones for 21 days.
* The experiment, led by Professor Lisa Henderson and Dr Emma Sullivan from the University, saw pupils undergo a series of tests with experts monitoring their behavioural changes throughout the period.
* Pupils experienced notable improvements in sleep, falling asleep 20 minutes faster on average and getting an extra hour of rest each night.
* Mood boost: Children reported going to bed 50 minutes earlier and experiencing a 17% reduction in feelings related to depression and a 18% reduction in anxiety.
* Positive impact: Professor Lisa Henderson said the results showed a smartphone ban could have a positive impact on sleep, mood and wellbeing, but cognitive ability improvements might take longer.
* Policy decisions: Dr Emma Sullivan said the results are crucial for informed conversations about the impact of smartphones on young people and may influence government policy decisions in the UK and other countries.

## https://til.simonwillison.net/llms/streaming-llm-apis

The provided Python code uses the `httpx` library to send a POST request to the OpenAI API with a JSON payload. The `aconnect_sse` package is used to create an event source from the response, which allows for real-time streaming of the API's responses.

To log the output of the stream to the console using this code, you can use the `asyncio.run()` function to run the `main()` function, which calls `stream_openai_response(prompt)` with a given prompt. Here is an updated version of the Python code that includes logging:
```python
import os
import json
import asyncio
import httpx
from httpx_sse import aconnect_sse

async def stream_openai_response(prompt):
    api_key = os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY")
    if not api_key:
        raise ValueError("OPENAI_API_KEY not found in environment variables")

    url = "https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions"
    headers = {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}"
    }

    data = {
        "model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview",
        "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
        "stream": True,
        "stream_options": {
            "include_usage": True
        }
    }

    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        async with aconnect_sse(client, "POST", url, json=data, headers=headers) as event_source:
            async for sse in event_source.aiter_sse():
                if sse.event == "error":
                    print(f"Error: {sse.data}")
                elif sse.event == "usage":
                    usage = json.loads(sse.data)
                    print(f"Usage: {usage}")
                else:
                    try:
                        chunk = json.loads(sse.data)
                        if chunk['choices'][0]['finish_reason'] is not None:
                            break
                        content = chunk['choices'][0]['delta'].get('content', '')
                        print(content, end='', flush=True)
                    except json.JSONDecodeError:
                        print(f"Failed to parse JSON: {sse.data}")

async def main():
    prompt = "Tell me a joke"
    await stream_openai_response(prompt)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```
This updated code logs the response data to the console as it is received from the API, using `print()` statements with the `flush=True` argument to ensure that the output is displayed immediately.

Note that this code assumes that you have the OpenAI API key stored in an environment variable named `OPENAI_API_KEY`. You should replace this with your actual API key.

## https://github.com/CITIZENDOT/SportsBettingArbitrage

```
* Arbitrage betting involves locking in a win or avoiding a loss by betting on all possible outcomes of an event with different bookmakers, taking advantage of differences in odds.
* Guaranteed profit isn't always possible, but avoiding losses is.
* An example:
  * Betting $1 on Team A (SportsBet) yields $1.9 if Team A wins ($0.9 net profit).
  * Betting $1 on Team B (SportsBet) yields $1.8 if Team B wins ($0.8 net profit).
  * Betting on both teams results in a loss.
* Adding a second bookmaker:
  * Book keeper 1: Team A 1.9, Team B 1.8
  * Book keeper 2: Team A 1.4, Team B 2.5
  * Arbitrage betting $6 on Team A (Book 1) and $4 on Team B (Book 2).
* The script helps find arbitrage opportunities and calculates how much to bet.
* Inputs:
  * Odds for all outcomes
  * Optional bookmaker names (default assigned)
* Covers all outcomes for all bookmakers in the input.

* Konfig was a developer tools startup focused on making API integrations easier
* We started in late 2022 with the mission of simplifying how developers work with APIs by providing better tooling around SDK generation, documentation, and testing
* Our main product was an SDK Generator that could take any OpenAPI specification and generate high-quality client libraries in multiple programming languages
* We expanded this with additional tools for API documentation and interactive API testing environments
* We gained some traction with some startups, but weren't able to build a hyper-growth business due to difficulties in getting customers to sign contracts and price points being too low
* We pivoted into a vertical B2B SaaS AI product, but didn't find enough traction to make it successful
* Despite the outcome, we're proud of the technology we built and believe our work could be helpful for others
* We're open-sourcing our entire codebase on public GitHub repo
* The codebase is being released exactly as it was when we shut down‚Äîno cleanup, no polishing, no modifications
* In the past 3 years, we built 4 main products and lots of miscellaneous things
* Lots of miscellaneous things include render.yaml
* I want to express my deepest gratitude to everyone who supported us on this journey
* Investors who believed in our vision and backed us financially are thanked
* Customers who trusted us with their business and provided invaluable feedback are thanked
* Teammates Eddie and Anh-Tuan are thanked for their dedication, hard work, and partnership through all the ups and downs
* Looking back on the startup journey, there are no regrets about leaving a job to pursue it full-time
* The experience has been transformative and taught more than success ever could
* As for what's next, I'm excited to explore new opportunities, see where the job market thinks I fit, and continue learning and growing
* Maybe someday I'll take another shot at building something of my own

This text appears to be an analysis and critique of the current state of artificial intelligence (AI) research and development, particularly in the area of large language models (LLMs). The author argues that the focus on scaling up model size and computing power has led to a misleading narrative about the progress of AI, and that this approach is unlikely to lead to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).

Here are some key points made by the author:

1. **Scaling is not the only factor in AI progress**: The author argues that emergent capabilities based solely on scaling are largely a myth, and that true progress in AI requires understanding the underlying mechanisms and modeling more complex problems.
2. **Human intervention is not a substitute for genuine progress**: The author notes that relying on human intervention (e.g., large teams of poorly paid science students) to compensate for shortcomings is not a viable path toward AGI.
3. **The focus on scaling has led to overemphasis on trivial progress**: The author argues that the focus on scaling up model size and computing power has led to an overemphasis on trivial progress, rather than addressing more significant challenges in AI research.
4. **Regulation based on arbitrary training compute thresholds is problematic**: The author notes that relying on arbitrary thresholds for regulating AI research (e.g., based on computing power) is problematic and unfair to small companies, startups, and academic researchers.
5. **The future of AI depends on a broader understanding of the field**: The author argues that the future of AI requires a more nuanced understanding of the field, including the development of new models, algorithms, and techniques for addressing complex problems.

Some of the key points made by critics of the current state of AI research include:

1. **Lack of transparency and accountability**: Some critics argue that there is a lack of transparency and accountability in AI research, particularly with regards to the use of computing resources.
2. **Overemphasis on metrics**: The author notes that many researchers focus too heavily on metrics such as accuracy and F1-score, rather than considering more nuanced measures of success (e.g., safety, interpretability).
3. **Insufficient consideration of downstream impacts**: Some critics argue that AI research often neglects the potential downstream impacts of AI systems on society.

Overall, this text presents a critical perspective on the current state of AI research and development, highlighting the need for a more nuanced understanding of the field and a broader approach to addressing complex problems.

## https://systematicindividualinvestor.com/2024/12/17/pyramiding-profits/

The article provides an overview of a risk-managed trading strategy that aims to participate in strong trends with outsized position sizes while minimizing regret if the trend fizzes out prematurely. The key elements of this strategy include:

1. **Tight stop losses**: Using tight stop losses to limit potential losses to around 1% of capital or less.
2. **Entry setup with an edge**: Identifying entry points with a clear edge, such as a strong trend or a well-defined technical setup.
3. **Laser-focused position sizing**: Using large position sizes to capture outsized profits while minimizing risk.
4. **Risk management as the secret sauce**: Recognizing that risk management is the key to making many momentum-based trading styles successful.

The article also provides an example of how this strategy can be implemented in practice, using a hypothetical trade involving Bitcoin. The trade involves:

1. **Multiple entries**: Entering multiple positions at different levels, with each entry having a smaller stop loss than the previous one.
2. **Trailing stops**: Trailing stops to lock in profits and limit potential losses.
3. **Position sizing**: Using large position sizes to capture outsized profits while minimizing risk.

The article concludes that this strategy is well-suited for investors who want to participate in strong trends with outsized returns, but are willing to take on some level of risk. It also notes that the key to success lies in managing risk effectively and being prepared to adapt to changing market conditions.

Overall, the article provides a clear and concise overview of a risk-managed trading strategy that aims to capture outsized profits while minimizing regret.

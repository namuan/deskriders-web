## https://www.runpulse.com/blog/why-llms-suck-at-ocr

```text
We believed LLMs could solve data extraction by plugging in the latest models.
However, we found that their probabilistic approach favors common words over exact transcription.
LMMs suck at complex OCR because they are excellent for text-generation or summarization tasks but falter at precise character recognition.
Their probabilistic nature causes fatal errors in OCR tasks due to lossy transformations and blindspots.

*I. How Do LLMs “See” and Process Images?*
LLMs process images through high-dimensional embeddings prioritizing semantic understanding over precise character recognition.
The attention mechanism splits images into fixed-size patches, losing fine-grained spatial relationships and critical information about data relationships.
LMMs struggle with complex 2D relationships like table structure recognition and extraction.

*II. Real-World Failures and Hidden Risks*
LMMs fail in catastrophic ways for business-critical applications in industries like legal and healthcare.
Failures include financial and medical data corruption, equation solving problems, and prompt injection + ethical vulnerabilities.

* Space Age sed is a Batch File Edit tool that shows a nice diff of proposed changes before committing them, allowing double-checking of edits.
* Unlike sed, this tool enables selective replacement and choosing the clustering factor for changes using --unified=<n>.
* It can display side-by-side changes using delta if installed.
* To replace all occurrences of a pattern with another in a repository, use `find "$FIND_ARGS" | sad '<pattern>' '<replacement>'`.

## https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1im35yl/how_to_scale_rag_to_20_million_documents/

- Popular vector databases for scaling RAG include Weaviate, PGVector, Pinecone, and Qdrant, with hybrid RAG techniques mentioned for optimization.
- ParadeDB (Postgres + pg_vector) and LanceDB are suggested for scalability and hybrid search.
- GraphRAG/LightRAG approaches can be used but are computationally expensive due to graph-based complexity.
- Horizontal scaling is supported by modern vector DBs through sharding and replication, though graph traversal slows down as data grows.
- Embedding models like stella_en_400M_v5 are recommended, with binary embeddings (quantized vectors) suggested to reduce storage and improve performance.
- HNSW indexing is a popular choice, while alternatives like IVF or IVF-PQ can improve performance through cluster-based indexing.
- Sparse rerankers like BM25 combined with dense embeddings enable hybrid search for better results.
- Index creation is more efficient when the index is dropped before ingestion and rebuilt after data ingestion is complete.
- Chunking strategies, like adaptive window chunking, dynamically adjust chunk sizes based on dataset requirements.
- Proper chunk overlap is critical to avoid losing context during retrieval.
- Preprocessing should include metadata extraction, semantic enrichment, and duplicate removal to optimize embeddings and indexing.
- Efficient pipelines are essential for handling diverse document types such as PDFs, scanned images, and statistical data.
- Segmenting documents by topic or content type and routing them to appropriate vector DBs improves pipeline efficiency.
- Middleware layers can compress, deduplicate, and summarize embeddings to optimize data ingestion.
- Azure AI Search is recommended for enterprise-level ingestion pipelines.
- Hybrid RAG combines dense vector search and sparse retrieval (e.g., BM25) for improved performance and relevance.
- Hierarchical RAG methods involve topic-based sorting before diving into chunk-level retrieval.
- ElasticSearch and BM25 are suggested as alternatives to vector DBs for certain domains with better relevance.
- Fine-tuning models on 20M documents can encode domain-specific knowledge but is more expensive and risks overfitting.
- RAG is cheaper, faster, and more flexible than fine-tuning and is preferred for large-scale data retrieval.
- Embedding 20M documents can take significant time but can be parallelized with multiple GPUs, costing between $1,000 and $20,000.
- Trade-offs between speed, cost, and accuracy can be adjusted by tweaking clustering sizes or chunking strategies.
- Ensure the dataset is relevant and up-to-date since larger scales do not always yield better results.
- Vendor solutions like Azure AI Search are helpful but should be used cautiously to avoid vendor lock-in.
- Iterative testing is necessary to identify the best combination of embeddings, chunking, and retrieval strategies for the specific dataset.
- Critics argue RAG struggles at scale, but others dismiss this as overly pessimistic, citing successful implementations at larger scales.

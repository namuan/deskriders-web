- MACHINA: CCTV viewer with realtime object tagger [WIP]
- Uses LLAVA, YOLO 11, OpenCV, and FAISS
- Connects to high-resolution RTSP stream, queues frames, and resamples for processing
- YOLO detects objects, assigns IDs based on coordinates, size, and timestamp
- Background thread makes LLM requests to Ollama server for object tagging
- Object matching uses center of detection boxes with 16px tolerance
- Test environment: 640x480 processing, 20ms inference time on GTX 1060
- Stream delays 1-2 seconds every ~10 minutes, frame skip mechanism implemented
- Prerequisites:
    - Python 3.12.x
    - Ollama server with LLAVA model
    - Compatible PyTorch version
    - Dependencies from requirements.txt
- Usage:
    - S: snapshot
    - R: start/stop recording
    - Q: quit app
    - Left mouse: select
    - Middle mouse: zoom
    - Right mouse: pan
- Project aims to create a complete headless security system
- TODO:
    - Additional UI Layer
    - RTS style object selection box with detailed information
    - Detection of crowds, car crashes, police, ambulance, running humans
    - Webhook callbacks for new/disappeared objects and movement after long stays

Pooltool is a general purpose billiards simulator crafted specifically for science and engineering.

Its core design principles focus on speed, flexibility, and the ease of visualization and analysis. With an interactive 3D interface, a robust API, and extensive documentation, pooltool aims to be a systemic tool in billiards-related research. Continuously evolving through active maintenance and bolstered by a growing community, this vision for pooltool emphasizes not just its current capabilities, but also its potential for growth and adaptation within billiards simulation.

Pooltool is peer-reviewed and published in the Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS) and pyOpenSci.

- Watch YouTube videos on how transformers and LLMs work:
    - 3Blue1Brown's video on transformers
    - Sebastian Raschka's "Build a Large Language Model From Scratch"
    - Andrej Karpathy's "Neural Networks: Zero to Hero" playlist
- Start with understanding embeddings:
    - Use SentenceTransformer to embed texts and visualize vectors
- Learn fundamentals of neural networks:
    - Implement a basic feed-forward network (e.g. for MNIST)
    - Understand backpropagation algorithm
- Study simpler language models:
    - Character-level prediction with RNNs
    - Word embeddings like word2vec
- Implement a small transformer from scratch
- Read architecture papers on models like T5, BERT, GPT-2
- Try recreating a minimal LLM implementation:
    - Karpathy's llama2.c as a starting point
- Explore "Spreadsheets are all you need" Excel implementation
- Review detailed LLM architecture diagrams

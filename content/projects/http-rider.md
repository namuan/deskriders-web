##### Features:

ðŸš€ Open source and Cross-Platform

ðŸš€ Lean and Faster than Java/Electron alternatives

ðŸš€ OpenAPI V3 exporter: You can export to OpenAPI v3 including the request/response schema which is lacking in other clients.

ðŸš€ Feature rich generators: Generating code for running performance tests using Locust.io or Slowcooker. Monitor with Runscope or just generate tests using Apickli or RestAssured. 

ðŸš€ Labels: A different way to group Apis which makes it easier to share API requests between different scenarios. Like Login API used for different use-cases. 

ðŸš€ Mocking: Embedded mocking support to quickly prototype an API

ðŸš€ Assertions: Create simple assertions for any request/response element and see the results on each run.

ðŸš€ Fuzz testing: Running quick test with fuzzed requests against your Api.

ðŸš€ Api Sharing: Share API using an open source [online service](https://www.httprider.com/docs/how-tos/050_sharing_api_exchange/).

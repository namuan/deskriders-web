There is a serious problem with the state of simple development tools on the internet. 
Most of the websites providing simple encoders/decoders/formatters/prettifiers are filled with ads and popups 😷 which makes it difficult and risky to use.
And then there is also a huge problem with privacy 👀 and leaking any private data that is used on any of these websites.

[DevRider](https://github.com/namuan/dev-rider) is an attempt to provide a desktop tool which includes a shell and addins for various utilities.

##### 🚨 Call for Help 🚨

The list of things that we can add is huge so appreciate anyone willing to contribute. I'm available to guide you through the application architecture and what is involved in making appropriate changes. Hopefully we'll learn something useful in the process 🙌.

⚠️ **Add more languages for code snippets**

DevRider supports curated code snippets for a tool. For eg, if you are using Base64 Encoder then it'll show you the source code to do base64 encoding in different languages.

So if you are looking to learn a new language then please don't hesitate to provide code samples for some of the tools already exists.

See https://github.com/namuan/dev-rider/issues for picking up a task as a first time contributor.

⚠️ **Add more tools**

If you are thinking about learning Python/PyQt then consider adding a new tool. Here is a page where I described the process of adding a Markdown Viewer https://github.com/namuan/dev-rider/blob/master/docs/devrider-adding-tool.md.

Also see the current list [here](https://github.com/namuan/dev-rider/blob/master/docs/more-tools.md) but you are welcome to add anything missing from that list.

Please like the [Github Project](https://github.com/namuan/dev-rider) and follow https://twitter.com/deskriders_twt/ for development updates and spreading the word out.
